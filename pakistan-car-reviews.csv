2019 Suzuki Cultus VXL,"I had this car for 5 years. Its great value for money for people who want to buy car around 10 lac. -> Exterior design is 90s fashioned but has much better aerodynamics as compared to many other cars like Toyota Corolla and other cars available in this price tag. -> Interior space is good for people under 6 feet 3 inch. It comes with standard AC/Heater, most people have replaced standard cd player with the DVD touch screen with 4 speakers. Comfort level is also high. -> If driven under speed limits, its fuel economy in city is 12-14 and on long drive it ranges between 14-17 depending on the driver. -> Ride Quality is 4/5. Sometimes it feels like under-powered(In case of breaking the speed limits or climbing the hills). It under-steers only above speed limits so handling is good. It doesn't have ABS but the standard breaks are pretty well.  Its strongly recommended for people who want to buy car around 10 lac. More ",5-rating,5-rating,5-rating,4-rating,1-rating

2021 Toyota Fortuner TRD Sportivo,"Just bought new BRV 2021 vtec S. It's good family car in its class, with good space for 5 adults and 2 kids (last row seat). Unfortunately some downs I think are, very low quality tyres (general tyres of cheapest range), problem in ""fit"" & ""finish"" of car. Horn of car is more Lowder inside as compare to outside (an amusement for my kids every time I honk), very low quality plastics specially central arm rest quality is very cheap. Caben light both at driverside (map light) and main cabin are from 1973 version. Door handles on inside should be mat black instead of shimmering silver plastic!!, quality of floor mat given with factory fitting is worst (just like paper thin towels), bonnet cover from engine side (nammda) need to be installed from own pocket. DRLs bearly visible in day. Suspension is harder than city and felt each pebble and every pothole in road while driving!!. Engine is delayed acceleration even with high octane!!.

2017 Nissan Dayz J,"Honda City has its own pros and cons. Personally, I am not impressed by the built quality of this car. I have kept it with immense care but still after 3 years and approx 70k milleage, there is a strange noise which can be heard from the engine while the car is accelerated. Even Honda itself is not able to determine this issue. Apart from this the dashboard of the car is loosing its paint gradually and it seems like the dashboard's original color was beige and the company spray painted the dashboard black. The performance and response of the engine is fine. But still even the top of the line aspire variant has no airbags and basic features such as traction control, automatic climate control, hill start assist, steering switches. I personally will not recommend this car to anyone as it priced approx 30 lacs. More ",1-rating,1-rating,5-rating,4-rating,5-rating

2017 Nissan Note E,"The best crossover in Pakistan hands down. The build quality,safety features,the drive, features,materials used are the best found in any car sold in pakistan. Quality on par with Germans. The drive,soundless even at highspeeds response from the 1.5T was great,not including the turbo lag which is normal for turbocharged cars. The pick-up is amazing. 0-60 within 10 secs. The interior felt exquisite and ""quality"" The Radar cruise control with MG pilot makes it pretty much autonomous. Now onto a few cons of the HS; Upon startup,there are too many dings and dongs notifying the driver about the assists on, which can at times get annoying. Another downside is the laggy-ness of the central screen which can get on the nerves as everything is controlled from the screen like AC,Drive assists etc. And now in my opinion,these driver assists are nothing but a gimmick for pakistani roads but are a good party piece.

2020 KIA Sportage Alpha,"I am driving this car from last 10 months, What I get after driving this vehicle. It is totally an awesome addition to Pakistan auto market. Kia Picanto build quality is really strong if compare with Suzuki and its quick pick + performance gives you an actual driving comfort. Regarding its fuel consumption then one thing I want to share, Picanto measures the average in liter/100km that gives you accurate reading on longer commute rather than on the smaller short distances.  Most of the time, I reset the meter before starting my longer commute approximately of 10, 15 or 20 kms within city then It gives me an average of 16-18 km/liter and on motorway when I reset the meter before commute then it gives me 18 - 20km/liter.  In summer, in AC works really awesome. I drove corolla and after driving this 1000cc machine, I really not get tired by its drive.  and please do not compare it with cultus in terms of quality, pick and performance.

Exterior looks are not impressive but if compared with its previous model, the overall look was much improved. Interior gives a pleasing experience because of 2 tone color scheme of beige and brown. Interior is capacious with multiple storage spaces which gives ample room for storage. Fuel Economy is a plus for specially this generation. The I-DSi engine technology was specifically designed for giving impressive figures. Mine gives around 14-15 kmpl in city and 17-18 on motorway. Build quality is much better as compared to new models, which is the reason why it has a very compact cabin with excellent sound proofing and makes a quiet cabin with no sounds of surroundings.

Interior, considering the features of course has more features and options than its competitor including the head unit.  Issues: open any window a little bit and the air comes through the switches in the doors. Glove box light missing, which will be addressed by the warranty. Rear cup holder cover in the arm rest has a deep scratch. Not sure if it will be addressed as i didnt notice while taking the delivery. I still have to figure out if the front lights adjust themselves and moves as per the quoted feature. Seats are extra hard not comfortable.  Handling is very good. Fuel economy is pretty nice.

Cons * Lack of a 4th gear makes this car a horrible experience on the highway. The engine noise becomes very annoying once you start going above 100 km/hr. * The price in Pakistan is ridiculously high. Regionally, this car competes with Mitsubishi Expander and Honda BR-V where the price of all three is within a narrow range. In Pakistan, Toyota Rush is priced so extremely high which is, in my personal opinion, the SOLE reason for its failure in this market.

2004 Honda City i-DSI Vario,"As far as the exterior styling is concerned the looks of the car are reasonably good, but I miss features like projector lamps and DRLs that come in some other 660 cars of the same year.  Interior looks average, but gets the job done nicely. AC is really good for a 660cc car The Seating capacity is for 4, with immense amount of leg space for front and back passengers. Quality of seats is good but you cannot comfortably take this car on long drives, as you will fatigue quickly bcoz the seat cushioning is very little.  The USP of this car is its Economy, I mostly drive on ring road and it gives around 23 km/L on AC with light foot.  Ride quality is above average, but it has a stiff suspension Handling is excellent, even on higher speeds it never feels that car is out of control even on sharp turns  Overall it is a good car for families to commute in city with excellent fuel economy and overall comfortable experience.

2012 Suzuki Swift DLX 1.3,"Suzuki Swift has very good interior but has total interior in plastic but we cannot expect any more from suzuki in Pakistan. Suzuki Swift Exterior is not much slim but looks like a flat car. It does not look any type of sporty car. From outside the car looks like it has a 660cc engine. In Interior, It does not have very much leg space and front room looks very bulky because of 1300cc engine. As far as the back room is concerned if the front seats are at medium position then their will be an sufficient space for people sitting in the back. The trunk is not too much spacious but it has reclining seats so if you want to load something you can easily recline the seats. I think that anyone should not buy applied for suzuki swift because of their price. You can get a very better used sedan in that price range. Buying Suzuki Swift for your daily driver is recommended but not on long drive. Thankyou. More ",4-rating,4-rating,3-rating,5-rating,5-rating

Safety features include 2 airbags, ABS, EBD, door crash beams, crumple zones, fireproof plastic, pretensioners. Resale is growing. Only problem is with cabin insulation.

Be aware of mechanics they don't understand this car very well and they can destroy your car and you will then say that car is bad. One time I had a spark plug issue and mechanic was saying whole engine will be re built and etc then I went to another one who was already expert in this model of car and he instantly fixed the issue within 5 minutes so be aware of that.

2019 Suzuki Mehran VXR Euro II,"I have driven my Honda City 1.3 MT for two years covering a distance of 30,000km. I bought it mainly because of its sporty outlook, better fuel economy, and the lowest price among all new sedans manufactured in Pakistan.  The Comfort level of Honda City is inferior to Corolla. Therefore, I have added one-inch foam cushioning in seats and replaced Eurostar tires with Yokohama Advan DB to get a reasonable comfort.  Inter-city travel fuel average remains 16km/l with AC and 18 without it. Inside Islamabad, it comes down to 14km/l, making it the most fuel economical sedan manufactured in Pakistan.  The value for money is 5/5. I recommend Honda to keep the price low and do not change the model. Rich ones will buy Civic while most Pakistani would buy Honda City due to economical factor.

When I bought this car in Feb 2019(zero meter) it feels very solid. But as the time passes(about a couple of month) the various parts of the car start making noises. Firstly the hood of the car was not properly fit and it starts making noise, then when I drove my car to about 5,000 km the rear driver's wheel starts making noise and now I have drove my car to about 25,000km and I am facing the exactly same problem, the dealership also don't know how to solve this problem.

Push Start, Cruise Control, Adjustable Headlights, Height adjustment of driver seat, Leather trim, Multi - media Steering, Colored Meter, All Auto Windows, Digital Climate control.  Fuel Economy In City (20-22 km/l) On Long (30 + km/l)  Varies from driver to driver and the driving style.  The drive itself is smooth. The problem is in the ground clearance which causes the car to touch some speed breaker (which can be avoided by crossing the breaker with slow speed and tilting the car). Suspension is pretty good and takes most driven issues. Car is stable due to low clearance. Turning is smooth. AC performance is very good considering the harsh environment of Pakistan.  Aqua is an excellent car with an excellent fuel average. The car has all the features that make it stand out. More ",5-rating,4-rating,5-rating,5-rating,3-rating

Fuel economy is disappointing around 9 to 9.5 The car feels sluggish and definitely grande is quicker. Major faults include stearing rack poor welding of doors paint chips off the door handles battery liquid leaks ac compressor makes weird noise when it's turned on The stearing is soft and the car handles perfectly road grip is also brilliant. The stearing rotates less than other cars for a complete turn. Traction control and vsa works Overall its a very good looking car and feels good to drive but corolla grande might be an option to consider especially if you go to the villages frequently.

2018 Suzuki Swift DLX Automatic 1.3 Navigation,"It's very spacious compared to the Cultus and Swift. 4 XL sized men can sit in it comfortably. The automatic gear system performs poorly in hilly conditions, so manual shift is recommended. The engine sound in the lower gears is very irritating, and sounds like a muffled two stroke motorcycle, but this sound disappears when you reach cruising speed. I enjoy driving it in manual mode. Vroom vroom. But Don't expect it to perform like a normal automatic car. Pickup is good. Steering is smooth as butter. The car has an immobilizer against theft. It has no spare wheel, and has a puncture repair kit and a compressor. I cannot comment on the practibility of this system until I get a puncture. I wish they could improve the engine sound, because it is a major drawback for this otherwise good car. More ",3-rating,5-rating,5-rating,3-rating,2-rating

2017 Honda Civic Oriel 1.8 i-VTEC CVT, 1) The size of the vehicle is optimal for anyone who is used to driving sedans like corolla 2) The engine is a 1600cc and provides the fantastic fuel economy while retaining all functions of a SUV 3) Vitara is not made in Pakistan its the only European car that is imported in Pakistan and has a full 3s dealership service support 4) 6 Air bags.... OH YES.... not even the most expensive local produced cars have that many air bags 5) Low maintenance cost and why is that because its a Suzuki with a 1600cc engine and is as cheap as maintaining an GLI or 1.6 corolla.  Whats bad about it.... Well its a SUZUKI and if you are a person who are fine with the quality of produce instead of its emblem then its the best buy at the given price range.

Only one issue I have faced is in manual transmission when you are on the first gear the pick of the car is excellent but in ags it doesn't give that much pick in 1st and 2nd but when you move forward it's totally superb. I recently went on the punjab tour my cousin had swift we both had a race on motorway initially swift had a gap because it has higher power after that cultus was ahead swift wasn't able to catch. As I had driven it 8000 plus kms so I can give much better review about it. i want to tell one more things the auto gear shift technology has taken pak suzuki to the other level where you can enjoy both manual & auto transmission.

2005 Mitsubishi Lancer GLX 1.3,"Suzuki Swift is a very powerful car offcourse with a demerit of high fuel consumption. In interior, airbags are the only thing that lags and they should have been incorporatedby now. Navigation system is really good. Electrix sidemirrors and all four electric powerwindows are a great feature but only the driver s side window is autpmatically controlled with a single push and that too just for lowering the window. Coming to the exterior, i think its still the same since 2010 apart from nose grill, allpy wheels and fog lights. The road grip is amazing. The ride is a bit bumpy at sometimes when compared with other vehicles of same category. The only comparison for swift in the current Pakistani market is Toyota vitz. But as per my evaluation swift surpasses vitz in other departments apart from airbags. The main advantage over vitz is availability of spares and availability of the zero meter car.

2001 Suzuki Baleno GLi,"It is a very decent looking family sedan that costs less to keep if checked via knowledgeable mechanic. With strong body, after ten years of rough use at time of sale it displayed very low corrosion. Though interior is plastic however, the quality is so good that it did not even bore scratch marks despite lack of polish. I would also like to add that apart from being comfortable, the Baleno gives excellent run; 15 kms with light foot in city use while over 17 kms on highway use are the figures that we got from this car. We traveled across Sind (from Karachi to Mirpurkhas more that 30 times) and back in days when M-9 was in pathetic conditions too however, despite that the car only cost us bushings and one damper over ten year use. I miss it, we only sold it because we thought that at 125,000 kms it may expose us to some unforeseen technical expense and we did not know a good mechanic.

1994 Toyota Corolla SE Limited,"??Style: As it is a budget car,so style doesn't matter. ??Comfort: It is more comfortable as compare to other car in its price range. ???Fuel Economy: Feul average is a point where Daihatsu Cuore is not a big deal usually. ????But a slight modification in Carburator by installation of ""CDI System"" will give you Excellent Feul Average (15-16km/L in City and 18-20 km/L on Highway). It is my own experience of installing CDI system and this feul average.CDI system installation will cost round about Rs:9000/- ?? Performance: Performance wise this car is excellent in its range. AC performance is awesome. Engine performance is also awesome. ??Value for Money: Yes it is Value for money. it has Excellent resale value and best performance according to its price.

The 510's engineering was inspired by contemporary European sedans, particularly the 1966 BMW 1600-2  incorporating a SOHC engine, MacPherson strut suspension in front and independent, semi-trailing arms in the back.[3] The styling is attributed to Datsun in-house designer, Teruo Uchino.[citation needed]  The engine was promoted by Nissan USA president Yutaka Katayama, a design developed through Prince, an acquisition.[4]  Launched in October 1967, body styles included a two-door sedan (1968), four-door sedan, five-door station wagon and two-door coup (November 1968).

Not a suitable candidate for drag racing due to low output  Fuel economy: Cannot remember exactly since I owned this car from 2002 until at least 2011.

2014 Daihatsu Copen Robe,"From front side, it looks good while from the back its a bit expanded which is not that graceful. If you buy the shape with eagle eye headlights it looks more unique with light blue reflection in the headlights and also more graceful tail lights. Overall the body is perfect for those who want their car to be small so its easier to drive but also want spaced interior. Interior is simple, nothing much graceful but its perfect for you if you don`t care about stylish features rather just some space to place your things. Talking about the power, cultus is powered enough if you run it without AC and just looking for a normal throttle not much racing. With AC it feels under powered but you can easily adjust if you keep it at smaller gear and give more throttle. If you drive it decent, the car gives amazing average. Talking about something people don`t know, if you buy the car in white colour it gets tough to buy front and back doors. Also, they are more expensive.

2008 Honda City i-DSI,"Well, to speak of its exterior; it's a bit sporty than its previous models and has resemblance with range rover as people say. Build is good, so is the ground clearance.  Performance being an utmost important concern, this crossover is in a way better than its competitor Honda Vezel and in some comparisons it lags too. Like the suspension I must quote is way better than that of Vezel but the acceleration wise Vezel takes the lead and that however is because of that car being a hybrid equipped.  Fuel economy is as good as a sedan and at times better, even. Depends how hard you're on the pedal. Also the driving modes will impact the collective fuel economy. Sports will give you an ultimate driving performance and pleasure but at the cost of burning more gas than Normal Auto mode.  Interior I'd say gives a rugged look, not kind of a modern style.

Front seats have good leg space and are comfortable but leg space is too tight for rear seats (can be fixed but requires alteration in trunk).

Interior: A nice interior, looks modern you won't find any exposed metal parts inside the car everything is covered with plastic housing like Hondas and Toyotas. Dashboard has multiple spaces for all your stuff including two cup holders. Two front speakers with a solid sound. And a big white speedo along with digital odometer. Seats are also comfortable for longer drives.  Fuel Economy: Fuel average is bad compared to the compilation. Gives you 11KM/L in city and 13KM/L on highway both are with AC.  Ride Quality and Handling: The AC is good enough to handle Pakistani summers even when the car is stationary. Solid suspension keeps you safe from bumps. Engine is also pretty powerful considering the car's body size but feels laggy in 4th and 5th gear. The car is also lacking a power steering.

Steering response is excellent and the car is nimble around the corners. Even with hand-crank windows it feels like a luxury car. Great fuel average. 13-14 in city and 17km/ltr on long route. Optimum ground clearance. Relatively new shape compared to Honda City. Dual Airbags in facelift edition. Feels like Altis Grande. Less waiting time and 4 lacs cheaper than GLI. Please buy XLI instead of GLI, Altis, Grande, City or Civic. Lack of ABS can easily be overcome by installing better tyres, brake pads and learning drifting. Also profitable in resale and taxi/rent services. Very roomy from inside, not congested like City. Higher seating position than Civic. Maintenance slightly cheaper than City.

2015 Toyota Corolla Altis Grande CVT-i 1.8,"Starting form exterior not the charming or wow-factor point, as now a days japanese cars with stylish curves and beautiful aerodynamics looks ,v2 looks a little roundy or does not have that defining edges feel which are even found in the old generation of swift currently selling in Pakistan. But still its shape is not too bad , not saying because I own this car but in this Price range and in Pakistani market its Great. Now coming towards the interior of this car, the interior feels fine does not have that premium plastic feel or any other carpet trims on doors, but it looks spacious and does the job. Now as i have said it looks spacious actually it is spacious talking of going on a long route with 4 Adults and 1 child , you will feel pretty comfortable.

2017 Honda BR-V i-VTEC S,"I think car looks fabulous but only thing most people mind is that its ride height is just too much but in my conception that differs it from competitors. A corolla has always been a car good at handling tough terrain. And those 7 speed paddle shift is just icing on cake instant power you get when downshift. well, that car was a good deal back in 2015 because now you get a corolla gli in that price bracket. maybe most people will buy a new gli rather buy an older version of grande but me being a petrol Head think that gli is just , just too much underpowered. Even grande has much better fuel effiency the reason being gli 1.3 engine has to suffer alot carrying load of body which was originally designed for a 1.8 2ZR fe engine. If now I compare my car to current civic which I also own a 2019 model still I feel much more confident driving my older grande because its tough no matter what piece of road you throw at it.

2002 Honda Civic EXi,"I find this car's exterior rather fascinating. Front looks very complete and gets its presence noted while the back is pretty simplistic and gives a sober image. Interior is kind of nothing very extraordinary but does not make you regret your choice or miss any feature. 1 thing that I wish for is a timepiece integrated in the central console as international variants of the same cars have. Other than that interior is spacious enough, it has ample storage space, upper portion of the glovebox is rather a sunglasses storage compartment and the manual climate control buttons do justice to the simplistic profile. Fuel economy; I have managed to get 14km/l without A/C in city and 18km/l on highway. With A/C it gets to 12.5 and 16.5 respectively, which is quite decent for a car that is much heavier than a Honda City 1.3. Ride quality is excellent. I find it very comfortable on long commutes.

The only problem which I face is that it doesn't have the seat adjustment option for both the front seats which makes it difficult for aged people to get out of the car .,4-rating,4-rating,5-rating,5-rating,3-rating

Interior is good when we consider price tag in this category but again Immobilizer , SRS Air Bags are not there at all, and music player is kind of old one.

Fuel tank has capacity of only 42 but it should be more than 55 Litres  Ride is more comfortable than you get in Corolla XLi/GLi on highways, but its up hauling on rural roads as it has lower ground clearance than Corolla.

Plus point is that this vehicle comes with full features and down side is, that its expensive then local manufactured vehicles but yet again you have to think about, its automatic transmission, has airbags, lane assistant, anti-collision detector, equipped with stability control and ABS brakes, worth paying for. Thing to look for buying this vehicle is, that you dont end up buying an accidental car, the low mileage vehicles comes accidental, but yet again, you need to look for the one where Air bags are not deployed, parts are changed in Japan and its not a serious one. I did not find this vehicle under powered, actually, I am pretty impressed, from inside, it gives a look of spacious 1.3 cc sadan but yet again has a very good turning radius and decent road clearance.

Excellent performance on CNG and Petrol as well as I never felt its fuel average is a burden on my pocket. I drove it for more than 200000 kms in rural and urban areas. Once in northern area. Its road grip and braking is better than new models. It never skid on hard braking or on water that's why I say it's braking is far better then new cars.

2015 FAW V2 VCT-i,"Due to word limit, I have divided my review into several parts. This is part 5. Performance of this car is somewhat okay , at least with this sort of engine. During normal city driving, this car never feels under power. During highway driving, this car still does not feel under power and in fact this car has a good driving pleasure. The only time this car feels under powered is when you have to quickly cross a single in final seconds or if you have to over take another vehicle which is going at roughly around 60-80 km/h. The gear box is a little bit noisy and by this I mean when shifting from one gear to another, the gear box makes that particular shifting noise. Brakes are okay when it comes to normal city braking but when it comes to braking in emergency, I would rather not rely on such brakes at or above 100 km/h in city driving.

2018 Suzuki Mehran VXR Euro II,"The best thing about this car is the fuel average, which is beyond my expectations.  My brother has a new 2017 Suzuki Cultus Manual that gives only 11 km/l, which is pathetic for that car. Even an Altis Auto can give you that much mileage. However, my Mehran VXR car gives an amazing average of 17 km/l, which is fantastic given the expectations of a fuel hike in the near future.  I drive 58 km daily and there has not been a single heating issue. The drive is relatively quick and handles smoothly. The car's break response is also excellent that has saved me from at least one major accident.  If you are a fuel-conscious person, and think that a car's only purpose is to get you from point A to B, and that spending on a luxury car is a waste of money, then believe me this is the best car you can find in the market.

1993 Nissan Sunny,"I bought this car last month, at first, its fuel economy was pretty much unconvincing, but as the car came into running, the economy became pretty good for a 1300cc automatic sedan. It is doing 12-14km/l in city and 15-16km/l on highway. One thing that disappointed me the most is that the music player doesn't even have Bluetooth connectivity. The performance is pretty well for a 1300cc in terms of picking up speed. One thing which made me conscious before the vehicle was delivered was whether a 1300cc automatic will be able to overtake vehicles quickly on two-lane roads, but I've driven it two-three times on such roads and I can't really find any difference between it and my 2015 Altis 1.6 Manual overtaking vehicles on such roads. Overall, this car pretty much falls into the category of 'providing value for money' which is very rare for most of Pakistani cars around. More ",5-rating,5-rating,5-rating,5-rating,5-rating

Drive is good, comfortable, the car always feels in control. I have driven it till 165kmph on motorway. Also have driven it more than 1000km in one day. Taken it on hilly areas with steep slopes and sharp turns. Acceleration and braking is too good. The car is powerful enough to easily take 5 people with luggage to any area. Interior is not bad. Obviously it doesnt feel premium because its a budget car. But the plastic used is fireproof so i will give good marks. There is no rattling like suzuki. With careful driving, i get upto 18km/litre on highways. On average i get 13 to 14km/litre. Yes there are minor issues like wind noise, hard gears in first 1000 or 2000km but they can easily be resolved. Me and my family love it.

2018 Honda City 1.3 i-VTEC,Its Exterior is very nice and good in material but not that advance. I bought it brand new from the showroom and the first thing its missing is an airbag which includes in security feature. The most other important thing is that it cost me around 1.7 million with registration but some good quality work is missing. But none other the car is the most loved Honda of all time because the ones who cant buy civic enjoy city which is a very good choice. It should have retractable mirrors and leather seats from the start not after market. If Honda starts to accept these things then City is the most used and loved car of all time.

2017 Honda Vezel Hybrid Z Honda Sensing,"Suzuki is renowned for its desirable motorcycles, but its cars historically haven't enjoyed nearly the same respect. The Suzuki Kizashi midsize sedan is a serious attempt to bring the company's automotive division up to snuff. Billed as a sophisticated sports sedan at a family-sedan price, the Kizashi generally delivers. It looks sharp, it drives well and its interior is one of the nicest in the segment. While the Kizashi is billed as midsize, its dimensions actually fall in between that segment and increasingly large compacts. This means it's in the unique position to compete against both camps. It's larger, more luxurious and better built than most compacts, yet less expensive and agiler than the midsizers. We think it's definitely worth a look, but the biggest obstacle could be finding one given Suzuki's limited dealer network. More ",5-rating,4-rating,5-rating,4-rating,3-rating

2006 Nissan AD Van,"The exterior of 11th Gen facelift has improved, considering the front bumper, Sideskirts and front lights but if we compare it with Civic X, Grande lacks the aggression and sporty curves which makes Civic take the lead here. Interior of Grande lags behind Civic. The positioning of the armrest and the overall middle panel of Civic is better than the conventional cup holders of Grande which looks same as of previous versions (9th and 10th generation). Interior of Civic gives a ""rich"" look from inside. The design(not quality)of ac vents and the overall feel of the Civic interior is much better. Fuel Mileage: This totally depends on your driving habits. Mileage of both car is somewhat same which is around 11km/l in city and 15 km/l on highways Civic drive is smooth but lacks the power which Grande has.

2017 FAW V2 VCT-i,"Exterior of the car show modern looks and so is the interior but when it comes to the engine, Toyota has used cheap local slave labor in Pakistan to assemble this car, so don't expect quality control from made in Pakistan Corolla. The tires it comes with is straight out of some local cheap rubber. It bounces up and down in the soo called brand new Euro tires it comes with from Toyota. I had to spend 40 grand more to buy good quality Michelin tires. The tools that came with car is honestly made in a local blacksmith shop. I believe Toyota management in Pakistan is getting a lot of kick backs for buying cheap local made parts. The fuel economy is good but it vibrates as hell when climbing 5 degree up hill. At first I thought the engine mounts might be of low grade but the mounts seemed fine. I would suggest to buy a Japanese assembled car and stay away from local junk.

And the head and leg room is amazingly good. one cannot expect a huge trunk capacity in a small hatch back but its is satisfactory too.  The performance of this variant has an edge to the other variants as it has a turbo intercooler installed. It accelerates faster than normals variants and no one will say that this car is 660cc.

2017 Suzuki Cultus EURO II,"Pathetic Fuel Economy especially on motorway. Accelerator of this good for nothing vehicle needs to pressed down to the floor to get it above 100Km/hr. As a result of relatively more pressure to get it up to 120Km/hr, the fuel consumption / liter is approximately around 10Km/l which is bad very bad indeed plus costs you hell of an amount as compared to other vehicles from Toyota or even from Honda itself.  Interior of car is just acceptable, with no options like push start, Sunroof , and stylish dashboard display it is not value for money, infact its absolute waste of money.

Turning Radius is 4.75m which helps u in driving in narrow streets and road turns. AC is really good.Suspension is feeling some how noisy, I think it's because of gaps in the body design. Very good road grip on highways I have dirven up to 160 at Motorway and its aero dynamic shape also helps on high mileage. Mileage depends on driving style rpm , I got it 15-16 on highways and 10-13 in local. I have drive 65000 KM. No vibration specially when buses cross u on high speed. ABS brakes means a lot on highway and Motorways It has good cabin space.. Trunk is awsome u can easily put two big bags in it and lot many things.Interior and other features like sound system is also fine as few ppl say that bad plastic is used are totally wrong.

2014 Toyota Passo + Hana 1.0,Exterior is this car is good but not much arrow dynamic. but its good to have factory fitted fog lamps in front bumper. one more thing which impresses me that this car gets parked easily anywhere. Interior of this car is awesome. It got traction control and echo idling and more over it got climate control Ac in it which doesn't come in any car of this price range. Sofa seats makes you feel like your sitting in your drawing room and i mean it due to lot of space in the car. Fuel economy of this car is not much impressive then i thought. but still it gives you around 10 to 12Km/l with ac. on long drives it reaches to 15km/l with ac. Ride and handling is 10/10. because road grip is to strong . might be due to ABS brake system.  My final Words : Great and very impressive car in this class. also really need to mention here that spare parts and all services of car can be done thru toyota authorised dealership.

Interior: I personally feel the spacious interior of the Vitara redefines Compact SUV comfort and driving intelligence, with a high level of finish throughout. Has got an excellent all round view and a high driving position Performance: It is extremely responsive car just need to floor the gas pedal. In Sports mode the car is very agile and with plenty of oomph.....Pedal shifters are a joy to use. The engine is ""Very Capable"". AllGrip (4WD) The all new Vitara comes with ALLGRIP, Suzukis fully integrated 4WD system, that maximizes road grip. One can choose from four driving modes: Auto, Sport, Snow and Lock with one turn of the dial.. This system lets you rediscover what the compact SUV was always designed for: all-out adventure Great fuel economy for such a capable car. Overall, I am in love with this car and feel thrilled and excited whenever I am behind wheel. Once in Vitara you feel like sitting in a much more luxurious car.

2007 Honda Life,"This car has full points in style. It has an amazing interior and awesome cockpit lighting. Pretty much everything about it is great from outside. However, underneath there are issues. Car will knock from day 1. I know other owners of this model having same issue. Standard reply from Shahnawaz motors would be to change fuel pump. I have changed 3 so far (only HOBC). Brake-pads will start failing at only 6000 KM. You will again get standard reply from them ""this is because of drivers rash driving style"". My driving style has been same since I started driving and never there has been a need to change brake pads before 16000-18000 km in any car. This again has happened to other owners of this model. However, Mercedes and Shahnawaz will refuse to accept that there is something wrong with vehicle.  Overall, I would strongly recommend to buy either A4 or BMW 3.

Since I always run this car at full speed therfore I don't care fuels economy. Its AC is very good. Without any service it is working very fine for the last 5 years. I carried out its tuning myself. Its body and paint is of very high standard and quality. Its colour is white. I am very lazy in its service and polishing but its shining looks like a new one.

2017 Suzuki Cultus,"Nothing new. Same old shape of 2009 still buzziing on roads as 2017 model in Pakistan.This is the main reason for its having lost resale value. New shape launched by the manufacturer world wide almost two years ago. Car assembling company in Pakistan didn't bother to take care of the sentiments of the brand users because they thought that launch of new shape of Honda City would pose a serious threat to marketing & sales of Honda Civic. Rather than doing away with further procurement of Honda Civic, they preffered to keep buying more & more units of old 2009 shape of Honda City, change its front grill and launch it as 2017 model. Honda Civic had a low resale value in the past, it has low resale value even today. In comparison with Honda Civic, Honda City has large clients base in Pakistan who want to see constant changes, not only in its shape but its engine, after every 5-6 years. People dealing with Honda affairs in Pakistan should try to understand this point.  More ",2-rating,5-rating,5-rating,4-rating,1-rating

2013 Daihatsu Move,"I thinks its a very good addition to the Pakistan assembled vehicle. an excellent value for money with power, style and performance. Further Honda also improves on the welding of joint issues as people faced in current Civic version. The car is not at all under power, it has a remarkable turning radius and a mind blowing air conditioner performance. Its width and length is precise, legrooms in all rows are overwhelming. If you compare with 1.3 GLi Auto, you will see the huge difference in pickup as Corolla Auto is very very much under powered and my friends who have bought those are very much disappointed due to pathetic pickup issues of Corolla (I personally drove to find out the same), on the other hand in BRV you will see a very good pickup performance even if both ACs (front and back) are ON and 6 to 7 persons sitting - tested with my family.

If anybody wants to buy a car who do not want carry loads with family member upto 5..... it is undoubtedly the best choice. Now come over to then cons! It has engine noise which seems to be an ugly part. Second the pick is ok but in the initial part is somewhat slowed. DVD player is in Japanese n u need to get it changed along with Nav system. Usually the car do not come with good tyres so ultimately u need to change it as well so u have to pay 30000 Rs or more as per choice/ selection of tyres. Lastly the mileage as it is not ZERO meter but is driven upto 40 or 60 k.

There is no intervalometer in the wiper, and you have to manually engage the wiper every now and then. The fuel economy of this car is way over-rated. Whatever you gain in mileage is off-set by expenses on repair maintenance of wheels bearings, suspension and steering assembly.  More ",5-rating,4-rating,4-rating,1-rating,5-rating

2016 Honda Civic Oriel 1.8 i-VTEC CVT,"Sporty exterior, a good evolution of design thanks to Honda's US design studio. The car gives the feel of a sportback, thanks to its coupe like roofline. This however, reduces head space in the rear for anyone who's 6 feet and over. Small details, like edges of the bonnet or the trunk or doors on some units are uneven and paint quality is average. which is better than toyota corolla where the quality of paint is pathetic. . And of course the extremely poor finish of the welds on the doors is very disappointing to see from a car that people are happily paying 2.5m to 3m. Because we don't raise our concerns over quality issues, our manufacturers happily rip us off by using poor materials to reduce cost. The interior is very driver eccentric which is a good thing. Again, minor defects are present. The stitches on the seam of the seats are uneven, specially on rear seats. The car drives well but desperately needs its tires to be upgraded. Not a fan of CVT.

2016 Honda City Aspire Prosmatec 1.5 i-VTEC,Exterior: Overall design is perfect. Steel Metallic color is awesome. Interior: I love the new dial in blue color. Very good sound system. Tall and bulky person cannot sit comfortably. Overall interior designing is perfect. Paint on dashboard can easily be scratched out. Fuel Economy: Car has SOCH engine which gives very good mileage within city driving. During long route its gives 15.5 km/lt on GT Road; and 17 km/lt on motorway; both with AC. Ride Quality: Ride quality has improved alot. To my surprise current model stock tyres performance is excellent. No need to change tyres now. Final Words: Excellent car to keep. Good turning radius in traffic jams and parking in small spaces. Maintenance cost is low.  More ,4-rating,3-rating,5-rating,5-rating,5-rating

The thing which I liked most was the facilities of Honda for checkups and maintenance. I always had a pleasant experience with them. Honda vehicles unlike other manufacturers, are designed as you get them and drive away. You do not need to do anything else.

All the features present in top of the line in local cars are present in this car such as immobilizer, power steering,windows and central locking with factory fitted remote system and side mirrors are also automatic. Engine is powerful and responsive. It can beat corolla 1.3 in a drag race. Suspension are smooth and same as corolla's. Easy to drive just like a small car. Great visibility from inside the car. Interior is good but plastic. Gives a feeling of cheap plastic. Abs and ebd helps driver steer in heavy braking and maintain control. The price is affordable 10 lac 50 thousand. Led tail lights. And factory fitted alloy rims and two front airbags. Resale is not that low. Spares are easily available. Engine is same of 1.3 vitz.

2016 Suzuki Swift DLX Automatic 1.3,Exterior is god looking. Interior is sleek with nice curves and modern look. Fuel efficiency is 14 in city and 17 on highway. Nice compact sedan with good leg room. Seats are soft and handling is easy. Drive is smooth. Ivtec boosts the engine after 3000 rpm. Its engine is soundless. AC chills even in hot summers. Power steering helps driver in traffic or rush conditions whereas ABS and EBD helps him to steer the car under heavy braking. Spares are not that much expensive and easily available at honda stores and local market too. Car dosent wobble at high speed due to stiff suspension. Speakers that come factory fitted are good with nice bass. Only thing thats bad is the cheap material used in the interior and front cabin pillers that block your view and becomes a blind spot. Rear Camera is also recomended. Air bags should be present for more safety. Body is light and can help it go from 0 to 100 in under 10 to 11 sec for 1.3l manual model.

2015 FAW V2,"Wagon R is a good car with a noticeably better pick than all the rest of Suzuki's budget offerings combined. The steering is also buttery smooth thanks to its electronic nature and the brakes seem responsive, even though they are not ABS. The exterior is okay. The front looks beautiful with the deer-eyed headlights. Fog lamps can be added to provide further beauty. However, the rear looks like a pathetic 'dabba' and it isn't streamlined at all. Fuel economy was good at 16-17 km/l in city traffic. The average dropped to 14-15 km/l with AC. One of the worst things I experienced with Wagon R is its instability at high speeds.; cross the 100 kph mark and the cabin begins to vibrate. Exceed 120 kph and the vibrations become unbearable to an extent that you have to slow down. I believe the cabin shake is a combination of faulty rims and the 'tall-boy' design. Wagon R's gearbox is a bit of a pain in the reverse gear but I think it will get better with time. More ",4-rating,2-rating,2-rating,4-rating,3-rating

2015 FAW V2,"I just completed my thousand km today and thought this car deserves my review. Previously I have owned Cultus, XLi, GLi and most recently swift. V2 is far far better then Cultus and nearly as good as swift. The only negative point against swift would be its interior quality but then it has 2 airbags! which is better then swift if you think about it and its way way cheaper then swift too!  After 1000 kms, it has never given me any trouble and I fully admire my decision of buying this car. It is fully loaded and please don't even think of comparing V2 with Cultus. Cultus was waste of money. Buy it! you will not regret!! More ",5-rating,5-rating,5-rating,5-rating,5-rating

2011 Toyota Corolla Altis SR Cruisetronic 1.8,"I need 2 cars so i like Faw s80 grand but before that big car i bought faw v2 so i can see their service and manufacturing quality so I bought faw v2. But after 100 KM i hear some whistling sound from my tires. I take my car to faw service station. They open up a tire and fix something. They told me not to worry, Just some dust issue. After 200 KM i hear massive whistling sound from my tires and i take my car to service center. This time they conduct a test drive but they didn't hear any sound so they told me. No to worry, Drive this car for 1000km then we will check it. But if you hear any sound from tires and it still continue then visit service center and we will fix that problem. I am confuse but They told me they will replace or fix your car without any charges. But Style, comfort and fuel economy is really great. I will update what happen next.

2006 Toyota Vitz,"Exterior: As far as the exterior of the car is concerned it is a typical Corolla so do not expect it to look like a Mercedes C Class or Bmw 3 series. It is a corolla so it will look like a Corolla  Interior: The interior of Altis full specification is brilliant it comes with Leather Seats, Cruise Control, A good Steering Wheel, A decent looking dashboard and feels exactly like AXIO G. Which is a Japanese high end corolla.  Performance: The 1.8 5 speed Auto engine is simply perfect it has enough power to pull the car up and because of its fuel to weight ratio the mileage that i get is 12.5 to 13.5 kmpl in city and 15 kmpl to 15.5 on Motorway while driving at a constant cruise speed of 110 Kmph.  Value for Money: The 1.8 fully loaded variant of Altis in 2015 costs above 2.2 Million Rupees which has exactly the same suspension and same features offered in a 1.8 Fully loaded version of 2011.

Its with black bumpers and rear wash wiper. A smooth and aerodynamic shape. Considering the interior, Interior is not very attractive due to its knobs. The interior is full of old school designed knobs. As per features, it has only front power windows and rear windows are manual. Rear legroom is so small. Difficult for legs to relax. Although it's automatic the engine is very smooth and no knocking. If u want luxuries u can go for fielder.

The engine is extremely noisy and the road grip is extremely poor on highways. Must avoid driving this car in wet conditions. Apart from the comfortable seats, copious legroom, this car is not worth buying at such a ridiculously staggering price of almost 2 million. If you want to opt for a corolla, go buy an Altis!

2015 FAW V2 VCT-i,"I have bought city aspire in black. Well the car looks just amazing. Very attractive. Interior is amazing. better than corolla's. But build quality is nt good enough. Plastic around. Leather quality is just fine while plenty of head room but not enough space for 5 people who are a little bit bulky. Leg room is good too. Now the performance is the area that impressed me. As compared to corolla, it has got some extra power. If you compare the two, you will feel this. But the bad side. It has got some hard suspension. Car seats are hard and hard suspension makes it worse. But the car does handle the curves better and gives you an in control feeling at motorway speeds. Fuel economy is pretty good. Getting almost 17 km/l on highway with ac with normal driving. Drops to 15 if I go harsh. Well I am very satisfied with this car. Would recommend it for people in urban areas cause jumps it villages will every time ruin the car underneath with 5 people on board. More ",4-rating,5-rating,1-rating,5-rating,4-rating

2015 FAW V2 VCT-i,"I finally bought it and I am very satisfied with it. I had a JDM car which was good but lacked in the area of pick, fuel economy and A/c in the heat. I have driven this car for 400 km and it has surpassed my expectations. The interior could be improved but when I saw the Invoice and realized that car is actually worth Rs 450,000 without tax then I had no complaints. The car has good pick, good AC, good suspension, good cd player & speakers, good looks, good clutch & gears, good fuel economy what else does anyone want. Ok it is not a brand in Pakistan yet but in comparison, no Suzuki car comes close to it in this price. As far as long term durability is concerned that will be proved over time.

Car drive smoothly and its an economical car, i used it on highways car handling and running stability and engine performance is good, it gives me max 17 to 18 KM (with AC speed max 90km and less breaking). Without AC max was 19KM on the long routs speed max 100Km.  In the city max millage was 16km and with AC Max was 14KM. You can improve the performance and millage by soft foot...

2015 Toyota Corolla GLi Automatic 1.3 VVTi,"This is the first time that Toyota Corolla assembled in Pakistan offered 1.3 Automatic. Previously it was 1.6 and 1.8 Ltr for last generations of Corolla in Pakistan by Indus Motors. It's factory price is Rs. 1827500. I already owned the 1.8 Altis Grande which I got delivery in month of July 2014 during its launching. I test drive the car before buying it and the waiting time was 4 months and was delivered to me yesterday. For city traffic like Karachi this 1.3 L is very good choice considering the traffic jams. As it is 4 speed auto so its fuel economy would be better than 5 speed manual in Karachi city drive. I took out from showroom and drive this car with light foot on pedal, it accelerates normally without any hiccups.

Interior is not as jaw dropping for the price one pays but is quite plain when you compare it with old model of 2010 and others in its class.Plus the finish of plastic is not in correct sync. The sound damping materials do cut out most of the traffic noise and give you a sense of calmness in Khi traffic.  Fuel economy is quite good and gives you an average of 11-12 km/l in the city .

2011 Suzuki Kizashi Base Grade,"I was waiting for FAW to launch its V2 in Pakistan. I had read a lot about it on South African websites. So I went to see it today. There is no feature that isn't in this car. It is fully loaded. Great interior. Stylish looks. I loved it. The only downside is a little bit of crude finishing, unlike Japanese cars. And the second is the low ground clearance (but the same as Suzuki Swift). This is important for Pakistani roads. I would advise FAW to increase it to the same as Suzuki Alto once they start production in Pakistan. However, in the price range it is a definitely a good buy. I would suggest people to buy it so as to make it successful in Pakistan. The fact that it is very popular in South Africa is a testimonial to its value for money.

2014 Honda City 1.3 i-VTEC,"Interior quality is good and overall designing is perfect. Cup holders are infront of gear, unlike Corolla in which they are at the side which makes then impractical. With navigation installed, it seems very attractive. I like fiber cushioning of seats more than its leader seats. Seat foam is hard and needs improvement. However, one can soften it by adding foam layer. Fuel economy is very good considering its pure 1300cc car. Local = 13-15km/l. Motorway = 15-17km/l without AC. No matter how rash one drives, City always gives good mileage. Its consumption is best at 3200 RPM with light foot (little release). Excellent car handling and driving pleasure. If Corolla gives driving comfort then City is leader in driving pleasure. Car is very responsive and turning radius is very good. Easily park in tight spaces. Best car for rash driving.

The point here is that all the cars not just camey or accord but in this range of price are giving features which kizashi is offering. Secondly when you spend 50 lacs on a car it is just not for a cruise control or an auto air-con, you pay 50 lac to so that a car makes a statement for you when you arrive in it, and the way i see it, its a dull car , boring front with plasticy honey comb grill and nothing impressive at the back except tail lights which are acceptable, and then comes in a biiger issue, suppose you arrive on a party in your big (well for pakistan) kizashi where your friends are waiting and start chatting up on cars so what is the one arrived on accordy , the other side in a camry and when you are asked about your arrival, just imagine saying i arrived in my KIZASHI.

2014 Toyota Corolla Altis 1.6,"Perfect size to drive in urban areas. Best car handling experience ever. Unbelievable driving comfort and pleasure. Body is solid. Acceleration is perfect. 1300cc for Lahore and 1500cc for hilly areas. 2013 and onward Honda City has high suspension and seats like Corolla and drive of Honda Civic. Suspension of both old shape Corolla and City is same. Corolla seats are soft because of this jerks do not transfer into body. Both companies use same type of suspensions. Honda City saves you minimum 2 lakh from XLI and 3 lakh from GLI. I would suggest to save this money and use it for refueling your new Honda City for next two years. This makes the equation: Toyota Corolla = [ Honda City + 2 years of free fuel ] So the mileage of Honda City becomes unbeatable with any other car in this category including Toyota Prius, which cost 10 lakh more. Which means: Toyota Prius = [ Honda City + 10 years of free fuel ]. Honda City is for educated class and Corolla is for uneducated class.  More ",2-rating,4-rating,5-rating,5-rating,5-rating

2013 Honda Civic VTi Prosmatec 1.8 i-VTEC,"My 2013 Honda Civic Prosmatec (the 1.8L I-VTEC) is sold by Honda for Rs. 2,142,000/- and for around the same price you can also get a 2014 Toyota Corolla Altis (the 1.6L version).  My only argument is that when I'm in my car, the one thing I get to look at all the time, the multi layered front display, the I-MID information panel and the dashboard can simply NOT be compared to a Toyota Corolla's (all plastic, 5 different materials and colors) 80's style display.

2013 Honda Civic VTi Oriel Prosmatec 1.8 i-VTEC,"The 1.5 Litre City Aspire Prosmatec is a total disappointment. Fuel consumption is approx 8km/l in city traffic and 12km/l on motorway. The fuel tank is only 42 litres and 70km/day driving in city implies refueling approx every 4 days - you are always at the petrol pump. The leather seats are poorly made, hard and tiring on long journeys. Getting into the front passenger side is an art - there is an ugly hump under the front seats which makes entry risky. If you happen to step on the hump, you will most probably slip and fall on your back. Glove box is so small and has a bulge of the lock inside along with 3 communication cables making it practically useless. The suspension is hard and very unpleasant on rough roads. There is no value for money in the 1.5 and the ""Aspire"" - better to buy the ""Un-Aspired"" 1.3. The car struggles on the Kalar Kahar slopes of the motorway. The fuel tank is under the front seats exactly where speed breakers rub a car's lower portion. More ",1-rating,2-rating,4-rating,2-rating,1-rating

Minds of 90% Pakistani buyers (middle class) revolve around 1300cc car whether its Corolla, Nissan, Mitsubishi or Honda. If all the facilities once given in Aspire 1.5 are offered in 1.3 version, very few (upper class buyers) would go for power, rest will opt for economy and resale.  So, Bad move in the eyes of 1.5 aspire owners but good move for Honda to earn profit. Let me assure you Mr CEO of Honda, you have lost a big %age potential buyers of your new city next year.

Now lets talk about the interior, the interior is nice but not very comfortable, it's only good to look at. The new Corolla also lacks very basic features such as Climate Control.  The car's performance is some what good, it's not because of the engine but because of the CVT transmission. The car's pick is very nice but it's braking doesn't seem to be very good, as takes quite some time to come to a stop when driving at speeds of about 80km/h.

2011 Toyota Vitz F M Package 1.0,"I recently sold the japan 2004 model car. I am really missing it though. It is comfortable, sportive and very cool. The drive is so smooth that you'll forget Civic or Corolla. The elegant looks and charm hidden in super drive is the grace of PREMIO. The exterior and interior is superb. The fully featured car with several Airbag options makes it great. The quality drive with classic suspension and handling makes it a heavy TOYOTA make. Yeah, the petrol average is a bit poor but, if you provide car tuning and oil change after every 3 months, it will surely give you 14km/lit. Final Words: Go for it! Find a cool reconditioned car.

2014 Toyota Corolla Altis Grande CVT-i 1.8,Exterior: Nice design and styling  Interior: Lots of biggies including indash navigation which is surprisingly good enough sound and feature wise. Just the maps need to be updated on more frequent basis. Quality and comfort of Leather seats is not bad at all. Infact seat is more comfortable than its competitors. It also comes with keyless entry and great styling of the dashboard  Ride Quality & Handling: Bumpy Ride as compared to its competitors. Even a small piece of stone would be enough to feel inside the cabin. High RPMs at after 80KMPH It has excellent handling on all conditions. I haven't found it in any lesser control on Motorway as others claim. Perfect Throttle Response. You can actually kick some butt of 1.8 Sedans (Auto Transmission)  Fuel Consumption Not bad for a 1.5L engine with so much power.

2008 Suzuki Liana RXi,"The most asked question about Wagon R is its mileage and for me as our 4th car this was the only concern for us and after careful calculation as a un-biased user it gives 14.9-15.1km/l in Islamabad ALL time with AC at maximum.  on highway I havent tested yet but will be around 17-18km/l max.  Now comfort, the VXL interior is very good except for these two issues that are, back windows are manual and Side mirrors are not automatic I dont care much for that because if you set mirrors once and you have AC on its not a problem. The driving posture is unique in a good way after driving Civic when I set I feel like driving an SUV and its a good feeling but seats are flat I feel like without proper seat belts I would fall off of them.  In short after we drive Civic, Corolla and Daewoo all nice saloons with nice road grip and interior when we drive this we dont feel bad or anything like you do when you drive Alto or Cultus and Mehran instead this gives you a nice feel.

Why would I even have a test drive or check it's comfort or fuel economy when it looks worse than Adam Revo. They have stripped off some necessary car beauty elements such as good front grill, air pressers, alloy rims, under-engine protective shields and the list goes on. They went too far with the practicality and now it looks more like a donkey cart than a car worth 11 Lakh. Gone are the days when people didn't have other options and they had to buy Mehran, Cultus or Alto. Now they are aware of the features, the cars have these days (Thanks to JDM cars). Wouldn't someone prefer a much better Passo, Vitz, Mira or any other JDM car over a local Wagon R for this much price? I wouldn't buy this car for more than 8 Lakhs.

After the launch of Wagon R the company has really changed my opinion, a car which looks small from out side but is very specious once you enters the cabin.Its height gives you an edge of commanding view and control once you are on driving seat, The suspension is awesome with an excellent engine pickup,the added features like power window and key less entry further adds to its comfort. the car is also economical on fuel. over all much better then cults and can be easily compared with Swift in its class.The AC also powerful. Draw backs........??? they should have also given power windows for rear doors, and should have ABS brakes, The car is going to capture the market soon.over all a good addition to the deprived market of the country.

2014 Suzuki Wagon R,"After driving and owning almost all the versions of hatchback suzuki cars being in use in Pakistan, I was inclined to buy the city IVtec this time. Got the opportunity to drive this car on it's launching which was a pleasant surprise. The car looks small but very spacious from inside while sitting at the driving seat you feel to be in a commanding position because of it's height. The A.C and brakes are effective . The acceleration is also reasonably good. The 2 tone dashboard looks beautiful. We should not compare it with the imported cars for abs brakes and air bags as they don't have the company backup or release value. More ",4-rating,5-rating,4-rating,5-rating,3-rating

2013 Suzuki Mehran VX Euro II,"exterior feel and looks not so amusing but still not so bad as well...  interior is one of the best among suzuki car,decent and luxurious... its spacious as well as comfortable with nice boot space,ground clearance..make us feel like u r sitting in some kind of jeep..AMAZING FEEL....  performance is way better than cultus ... though not as good as swift.. but still its best among other 1000 cc cars  ride quality is pretty good as handling is easy and smooth..gear shifting is nice...  fuel economy gets the biggest edge among all other cars (excluding hybrids) as i personally get 19 kmpl on smooth driving..  Go for it if you practicality, comfort and value for money over style and speed. Although its not a bad looking car. You can't get a car with all these features in such a low price tag. Excellent package. But my suggestion to go for VXL which costs just 40k more and you don't need to spend much on accessories. It will be peace of mind.

2013 Honda City Aspire Prosmatec 1.5 i-VTEC,"I was excited to know about this new car in Pakistan so I went over to FAW Punjab Motors at Multan Road to see it for myself. They had the olive green model on display. I inspected the car thoroughly. Initially I was of the opinion that it was good value for money. But close inspection showed otherwise. I think a fair price for the car considering the quality of the material used in the car is around 15 Lakh at the most. The quality of the rear seats is definitely not one that you would like on a long ride, which is what these cars are intended for. The seats are basically stiff and of very poor quality. However, the good thing is that they are held by two nuts only and thus can be changed. The doors close a bit too loud and the side view mirrors are shaky - something reported by a South African user as well. The gear box is basically cheap as well. On the positive side, the headlights and the LED side indicators are cool. Also it comes with dual airbags, ABS and a powerful AC.  More ",0-rating,0-rating,0-rating,3-rating,2-rating

2013 Toyota Fortuner 2.7 VVTi,"Exterior: It doesn't look that great nor appealing as compared to better SUVs like PRADOS and CYGNUSs  Interior (Features, Space & Comfort): Interior is little ok, as it comes with Leather seats and rear air conditioning ducts on the rear.  Fuel Economy: Fuel economy is average.  Ride Quality & Handling: Now that's where the problem starts, hard breaking is common and quite dangerous. The only way that the ride quality and handling can improve if IMC added more safety features like more airbags, traction control and VSC. This is why I don't suggest this SUV  Final Words: It's over-priced with no good built quality, and brakes are very dangerous and can cause the SUV to loose it's control, therefore not recommended by me.

2011 Toyota Corolla GLi 1.3 VVTi,"People who come on Swift after driving cars like Cultus, Mehran, Alto always say that swift is a perfect car.  My cousin came on Swift after Mehran and he always admire the Swift by saying that swift is as comfortable as Accord and as powerful as Gli.  But how can a Mehran user say such words? Because Mehran does not satisfy definition of car.  I came on Swift after City (on advise of my Mehran user cousin) and I was shocked because Swift is far low quality car as compared to City.  Only exterior metal quality and engine can be compared with City But Seats, Interior plastic and suspensions are far lower in quality than City.  My Swift's interior started to give tick tick noise only after 12000km. Tick Tick noise come from every door and in amplifies on bumpy roads.  Seats are not comfortable as compared to City or Gli.

2013 Honda City Aspire Prosmatec 1.5 i-VTEC,"Being a car fanatic, I always hated Suzuki Mehran from my childhood. And my favorite activity (like many of Pakwheelers) was to insult Mehran in every other post :)  But when I entered professional life, I realized I can't spend my weekends in workshops just to get my vehicle running during weekdays. That was the time I needed some new vehicle.  My maximum budget was 900 K and the only brand new car under this budget was Suzuki Mehran. Other options were to add some money and buy Cultus or go for imports (Mira, Alto or Passo). My considerations were running costs, ease of maintenance and resale.  Analyzing these factor the optimum choice came out to be Suzuki Mehran. I currently own both the VX and VXR versions.  Fully satisfied with the VX one but the VXR is horrible on fuel average even with AC off.

2013 Toyota Corolla 2.0D,"Exterior: Stylish. Could have been better though. But over all, a good decent look.  Interior (Features, Space & Comfort): Excellent interior in it's category. Spacious, good quality plastics used and comfortable seats. Very beautiful silver built-in music system's dashboard.  Fuel Economy: This is probably the ONLY con of this car. Fuel-wise it's not as efficient as a city or vitz. However, this also depends on the driving style.  Ride Quality & Handling: Amazing road grip. Superb acceleration. Really feels like the seat slipping from under you. No car can catch up to it. Not sure about the new Aspire 1.5 - but all the 1.3 cars were never up to the challenge of speed posed by this little beast.  Final Words: This is one of the best cars to be rolled out of the PS assembly factory yet. The build quality is as good as a Civic (if not better). I can say that because I also own a Civic 2013. I have driven this Swift very rashly as well, taking it to far fledged areas of Punjab - but it's smoothness in the drive was never compromised. My advice to people who are considering to buy a 1300CC car - go for a Swift - an excellent ride for urban to sub-urban dwellers. Even though I am myself a Honda fan, I would recommend this Swift over a City (unless you want to go an extra mile and get the Aspire 1.5 which is a total waste of money because a few more bucks will get you an Altis - a far better car than Aspire). City's suspension is the worst ever - Swift is a very good car and can fit in many different roles - a first car for a young professional, a first car for a young couple or a small family, a second car for a upper-middle class family, etc   More ",5-rating,5-rating,5-rating,5-rating,0-rating

2013 Audi A4 2.0 TFSI,"I bought Swift DLX manual back in July 2011. Within the first month of its use, I experienced a tuk sound in low speeds and quick pick up. It was very annoying for me so i reported the same to My dealer (Suzuki Taxila Motors) from where I initially bought the car. I was told that it's the axle's fault. They reported the matter to the company. An authorized person (Mr. Ibrar)of Pak Suzuki for this region checked my car and said that its because of a pin in the gear box and that needs to be changed. so they lowered the gear box and changed that pin. the sound went off but only for a week. it came back and is there ever since.... Finally I was told try to live with it 'coz even the Japanese can't do anything about that......It really frustrates me!!!  So did anyone experience the same sound?? and found any cure for that??? plz respond!  Apart from that the car is Ok as far as its style and comfort is concerned. Fuel consumption is not that gud. Would give around 11 kmpl in local with AC and 14-15 KMPL on the highway. without AC the local average goes to around 12-13 kmpl and on highways from 15-16 kmpl.

2012 Honda Civic VTi Oriel 1.8 i-VTEC,"Exterior: Many people disagree but Honda City offers a strong built car and much better than Toyota Corolla GLI. Toyota has been bulking up the new Corollas and this is one of the reasons it gets scratches and dents the most in our crowded traffic of Pakistan. The shape is more focused towards young guys with an aggressive look.  Interior (Features, Space & Comfort): Honda City offers a beastly interior. The elegant black interior and completely different shapes provides a very sleek and appealing interior. It's indeed not as much spacious as Corolla but at least it's new and awesome! While on the other hand, most of the Pakistan manufactured cars are offering the same interior since ages. Thank God Honda has thought of something new. The car is comfortable enough but not the best. Seriously, neglect this factor as there is much more and if you care so much about the comfort then get a soft pair of tiers and you can have pretty good comfort. The car has enough room to relax and stretch for five persons and put your goodies in the huge trunk. The most coolest feature in terms of capacity is they are now offering very good amount of space below the rare seats where you can put your small items i.e Laptops.  Fuel Economy: The best in Pakistan. No other Pakistan manufactured car could be a comparison. The reason is simple that Honda has not bulked up the car with unnecessary amount of weight. The car runs perfectly fine on Petrol and on CNG as well but make sure to get it done from someone good who knows what he is doing.  Ride Quality & Handling: Again, the best among the Pakistan manufactured cars. The engine is soundless, the handling is just perfect! The car is fully under your control at maximum speed and the ABS is your best friend.  Final Words: Let me explain. When you'll try to buy a City people are going to say ""The spare parts are expensive"". Let me tell you, they are not! The better item, the higher the cost. They are a bit expensive but they are affordable. Or better yet, just get your car insured. Secondly, people are going to claim that Honda City has a low resale value. I'll agree but then again, the car has been underestimated. Anyone with a good brain would prefer Honda City over any other car that you'd get for the same amount.  Thank you Honda!

2013 Suzuki Swift DLX Automatic 1.3,"Exterior: The overall look is great  Interior (Features, Space & Comfort): Has excellent set of features, lots of buttons, everything automatic. Pak Suzuki however (compared to the international version) has removed ABS, indicator lamps from the side mirrors, Outside Temperature reading and Estimated Mileage reading from the Pakistani version of Swift.  Fuel Economy: 12 KMPL  Ride Quality & Handling: Ride quality is horrible on bumpy/damaged roads. Pak Suzuki is not fully doing there job when it comes to finishing. They probably don't even do a drive test before the car is made ready for delivery. You can spot a thousand problems in their brand new car, mostly mechanical issues. The inside of the doors are bare metal without any padding of sound absorbing materials etc. So they vibrate when you crank the volume up on your sound system. Also on bumps the ride gets too noisy. On smooth roads however the cabin is pretty quiet. Suspension is hard, but that gives you the advantage of good braking and good handling.  Final Words: It is for sure a lovable car. You can really feel the thrust with which the car moves when you push the accelerator all the way down. One reviewer mentioned that the car doesn't move above 120KMPH but this is because he couldn't really push the accelerator further down. I'm not sure whether this is a feature or not but accelerator pushes very easily until a point. Beyond that point you need to press it quite harder and that is the point when the car actually goes above 120KMPH. Build quality sucks big time, but the engine doesn't. I'm really enjoying my ride.

2012 Honda City 1.3 i-VTEC,"Exterior: Very Stylish  Interior (Features, Space & Comfort): Features are good, not everything is in it which should be according to the Fat price tag but its still a Good bargain,Space is way above any of its competitors (in the market) with proper 8 seats and luggage space to boot. Comfort is..... well this car is mad3e on the chassis of Hilux, its basically for the person who wants to buy a Hilux but find its harshness a no no for the family, Basically its a hilux for the family with complete space, seats and OFFROAD capabilty.  Fuel Economy: Ok for a 2.7 Liter, not good if u drive it with a heavy foot  Ride Quality & Handling: If you are an offroad enthusiast than this is the car for you, It has ALL the things an offroad car should have. It has ground clearance, Limited slip differential, manual 4x4 transaxle, proper heavyduty chasis and body for offroading. Its not a softie like the Honda CR-V.

2013 BMW 5 Series,"Exterior: The styling is excellent and the car is very attractive. It's sleek and it's actually shaped like an arrow. Overall, the design and build is fantastic.  Interior: The interior is brilliant, especially if you opt for beige cloth instead of black. The quality of the upholstery and all the materials, even if they are plastic, is very good. The stereo system is also a good one for this price range.  Fuel Economy: Fuel economy is exceptional in this car, it achieves 11.4 km/l of mostly city driving with the A/C on all the time and being thrashed around. Because of the current CNG crisis, buying this will help preserve CNG reserves.  Ride Quality: The ride quality is very good, and it's not as hard as many people say, but it is harder than a Corolla. That might be a good thing because this feels better over bumps than my old GLi, that was too jumpy.  Performance & Handling: This being a Honda, lives up to expectations and the acceleration is amazing. Handling, too is brilliant, even at high speeds, like 130 km/h, it does not wave around or vibrate much. Acceleration is better than the Swift or GLi/XLi and it can easily take them in a drag race.  Final Words: Honda has outdone themselves with this car and this is an excellent buy for anyone thinking about it. This is better than the GLi/XLi or the Swift/Liana, and I can vouch for that having owned all of them. I would recommend going for the auto as the manual is jerky, but you should test drive it as you may feel differently. Thank you.   More ",4-rating,3-rating,3-rating,5-rating,4-rating

2012 Honda City,"Dear readers,  I did a lot of research to buy a new car in 1300 cc range. My choices wer Xli, City and Swift. After digging the threads and user opinions, I was totally confused in making a choice among these 3 options. Personally, I am a fan of Honda since I have been using Civic for the last 10 years and owned almost 4 different models of Civics. I was totally against buying Corolla as I am used to drive Honda. Later, I took test drives of both City and Corolla and decided to go for Corolla this time. Civic was out of my pocket. I am now very happy and satisfied with my selection.. This new Xli is beyond my expectation.I can safely say that Corolla has got some good driving pleasure with comfort, economy and great looks.  I hope my post is going to help those people who are stuck in making decision to buy a new car. Go for Corolla, you will not regret. Good resale also :)  Take care.

2013 Honda City Aspire 1.5 i-VTEC,"Exterior: Its Aspire model, so its look good with company fitted Rims. I have taffeta white.  Interior (Features, Space & Comfort): In comparison with Gli 2013, City Aspire has more features like Navigation, Rear Camera, 4 speakers, leather seats, etc. It's trunk is bigger than Corolla's trunk. Corolla has bigger cabin but city is more comfortable.  Fuel Economy: No doubt City has better fuel economy currently it's giving me 12-13 km/l. As it's only 250km driven. New car eats more fuel , but with the time it's fuel economy will increase.  Ride Quality & Handling: Ride quality is just acceptable. Handling is very good as it's suspension is very hard. Hard Suspension, i think it's a plus point for better handling but a negative point while driving on bumpy roads.  Final Words: This is a complete family car, only for Urban Areas.

2008 Toyota Corolla Axio,"I brought the car 3 years back. Its the fully loaded version at that time, power steering, power windows and alloy rims. So far after three years every electrical and mechanical equipment is working fine. This car has the best leg room space in its class no doubt. I have also driven the Honda city, the rare and front leg room of Cultus is amazingly equal to HOnda City and the ride is even much more comfortable than Honda City. Its unfortunate the Suzuki has stopped the VXL version of cultus (only to promote the Swift) but I wish that they re-launch its fully loaded version with Electrical Power Steering (EPS). My VXLi has hydraulic Power Steering. Overall its one of the most comfortable, reliable and fule economical car in town given me almost 22 kmpl on highway and 17 kmpl in city with AC on CNG. On petrol it gives almost 17 kmpl on highway and 15 kmpl in city with AC. I am very much satisfied with this car and am using it for the past three years without any problem.

Next door in India same shit has been changed to modern look, quality is much better and available for 1/2 of the price compare to Pakistan.  Every time government try to relax imports duty on cars. Pakistan car manufacture/ Assembelers start shitting in their pants. They cry we will not be able to compete and go out of bussines. This is UNJUSTICE to Pakistani cars consumers.  Bottom line is better to buy used JAPAN assembled imorted small cars. They are way better than SHITY MEHRAN. What a JOKE after 30 years of maunfactering same SHIT.

2012 Suzuki Mehran VXR Euro II,"This car (Reborn) is a must buy if you have the required cash. It is an excellent choice and I don't regret it in any way :)  Exterior: Really stylish. Opposed windscreen wipers add a premium look. Looks fantastic in Silver and White.  Interior (Features, Space & Comfort): Generous amount of features. Air Conditioning fan speed control is excellent as you have a wide range of fan speeds rather than the traditional 4 speeds. Very spacious cabin with a nice set of seatings. Headrest is a bit annoying but can be removed. I found the boot/trunk space a bit limited.  Fuel Economy: Fuel economy increases day-by-day. Highway economy is excellent from the start! I would recommend everyone to fuel up with 50% Hi-Octane and 50% Super (Regular) fuel, it increases the engine life and has various other positive factors.  Ride Quality & Handling: The drive is unmatched. Handling depends on tyre quality. Speaking of which, I would recommend everyone to replace their tyres immediately after the car purchase as the stock tyres are extremely hard which give a very bumpy ride. Stick to stock tyre size or if you want a good look extend to a max of 205/50 R16. Yokohama Advan DB would be recommended.  Final Words: A great family sedan for everyday driving and for long trips. Go for it! ;) More ",4-rating,4-rating,3-rating,4-rating,0-rating

2012 Suzuki Swift DLX Automatic 1.3,"Honda has been a trendsetter and especially in Pakistan people find it very hard to accept change. I don't want to sound bias just because I recently purchased one ;) but because the surprise that this car gave me in so many aspects. Firstly came the price tag which was a little pinchy however not very bad compared to other cars in the category for example the altis which is a 1.6. Secondly came the looks which people compared that to the city, but believe me once you notice the car for the second or third time it looks good and eventually grows over you. Thirdly the drive and performance was ecstatic although when I first heard about the Eco drive I thought that must have reduced the horses running in the engine but the Extra 10Hp from the reborn engine can quite be felt when you floor the pedal even the mighty swift can't pull away till 100 now, but that being said the car has been a pleasure to drive, it doesn't provoke you to speed rather tells you to enjoy a simple drive with your loved ones. I feel the main reason for the civic not really being hot news is a catchy name, so I decided to call it the ""Mutant"". If your car requirement is that of a luxurious, powerful yet economical as well as a hight tech and safe family sedan, then without a second thought GO FOR IT.

Suzuki Mehran VXR Euro II,"Well Corolla and City owners are just throwing bricks on each other. Both Corolla and Honda are good cars so please give honest reviews.  I own both GLi 2012 and Honda City Prosmatic (October 2012 model). So heres my experience about HONDA CITY.  Pros 1 - Very stylish looks. 2 - Fuel economy is excellent. My Prosmatic gives me 18 on Highways without AC provided I keep speed at 100 Km/Hr. Within city in lot of traffic its giving me 13-14 without AC. On the other hand Corolla Gli MANUAL due to its weight and bulk hardly gives me 12 within city and 14-15 on highways. 3 - Titanic interior now being offered is really stylish as compared to Corolla. 4 - Price is less as compared to Corolla. My prosmatic with company fitted Navigation/Multimedia cost me Rs 1,696,000 whereas Corolla Gli manual without any Multimedia/Navigation currently cost the same. 5 - Honda City is really quite while driving there is no engine sound at all. Its also really streamlined for effecient Airflow reducing air drag and noise. Corolla's engine on the other hand is not so quite.  Cons 1 - Seats are Hard and are not at all comfortable as compared to Corolla. 2 - Suspension is hard and seems much delicate than Corolla. Even in the first 1000 Kms I have realized that Honda City is not made for rough Roads. You have to take great care not to take it to bumpy roads. Corolla however, is made tough for any type of roads. 3 - Although more fuel effecient, engine seems to have less power as compared to Corolla 1.3. 4 - I have experienced minute knocking so I have to mix High octone as a remedy which solves the problem. Corolla's engine happily accepts any type of petrol without any knocking etc.  Conclusion: If you travel alot on rough bumpy roads then Honda City is not the car for you. However, provided you stay on known/smooth/good routes than this car is probably the best possible option for you.   More ",0-rating,0-rating,0-rating,5-rating,5-rating

No doubt Corolla Altis SR Cruistonic is one of those cars that took my nasha away of a reborn oriel in many ways...yes (1)Vertical clearance for Pak roads, (2) Durabality as compared to Honda is better (3) Resale of Altis is better and quick (4) Fuel consumption is better than oriel pros giving 9-10km/L local and 15km/L on long BUT yes there is always a but.......drive cannot be compared to that of the Honda Oriel Pros (5) spare parts i.e maintenance cost has a big difference in both these cars...Oriel is far expensive then Altis bcz at the end of the day we dont just buy the car we have to keep it running as well so bottom line...if u can caress ur car like a gf and have its nakhra tu yes Oriel but if u wana get a wife durable reliable cost effective and most of all stuborn tu ALTIS ...cheers guys More ",3-rating,5-rating,1-rating,4-rating,3-rating

Toyota Corolla GLi Automatic 1.6 VVTi,"I upgraded my Mehran 2010 & bought Euro 2012 version. I will like to share my experience with all PW family. PROS: In comparison with 2010 its better body. Brakes are bit better. Seat cushions are really good when I compare it with my 2010 model( when it was brand-new with hard , noisy cushions), Central locking Interior feels bit spacious than older models. Head lights are very good EFI with good pick CONS.: same interior with slight change on inner roof fabric. Very cheap dashboard Mileage is not as good as claimed by suzuki, it has been driven 900 kms, but fuel average is 15 in city , 17-18 on highway.

Toyota Corolla GLi 1.3 VVTi,"Corolla Altis Cruisetronic SR, currently the best offered by Toyota Indus is a pretty smart choice to go with. The comfort level of this model with spacious interior offers a pleasant driving experience with leather seats and the very elegant wooden interior, Toyota's speciality, which it's competitor still lacks, giving a boring look with no wooden interior. The cruisetronic option that was offered in Toyota back in 2008, is now being offered in Honda after four years, which gives you an amazing highway experience. the fuel economy is no more then 9-10 per km, which is not very good compared to the imported vehicles in this class but still far better then Honda. The suspension installed in Toyota is customized for our roads, digesting all the bumps and lumps of our roads.  comparing it to Gli AT 1.6, if you consider value for money for these two categories,Gli is very much over priced.if Toyota actually wanted to serve the customers who are opting for foreign assembled automatic transmission vehicles,i wonder why they didn't offer A/T in 1.3 that would have been s more economical attraction for the customers.

Honda Civic VTi Prosmatec 1.8 i-VTEC,"The long awaited civic is finally hear. It has received dull reviews abroad and after scrutinising one recently I can relate to the negative reviews. Shape and interior styling is nice but poor quality really dampens the mood. Dashboard is all plastic. Door handles spray painted in silver. Moreover lining pads on the pilar are uneven. The body seems weak and prone to rust going ahead. Honda are charging so much yet they have left areas which need to be addressed. There is no inner lining beneath the hood and boot cover. The leather option does not include a leather steering, ridiculous. If your height is around 6ft then make sure you sit in the front. Electrically adjustable seats and VSA would have been a good option especially in the top model which nears 2.5mn. Haven't driven one as yet so can't comment on comfort and performance but I assume that performance would be exciting. Also I hope the turning radius on this model is improved as reborn has a horrible turning radius. More ",3-rating,3-rating,5-rating,3-rating,3-rating

Toyota Corolla Altis SR Cruisetronic 1.8,"I recently has bought new civic 2012 i-VTEC prosmatec. Overall I love the car and its driving experience. So far I have drove 1000km and on 1000Km its giving me 10.5 km/l average with my drive mostly in city area.  Previously I own 2006 and 2010 Corolla GLI. As I compare my new civic with Toyota Corolla below are few differences 1. Suspension of Civic is really hard as compare to the smooth suspension of Corolla. I really miss my corolla when driving on bumpy roads :). But when i compare its Handling its way too good then corolla.  2. civic has excellent acceleration and a very good auto gear shift. I have drive 1.8 and 1.6 altis but civic is faster than both and I have compare reborn 2006-2012, new civic has the same engine and transmission but better drive than its predecessors'. New civic is faster then the old one becoz of weight reduction.  3. New civic has many good features and a very decent and elegant interior, which give you complete feel of control over the car. steering controls, iMID display, height adjustable seats and a beautiful blue glow in dashboard lights.  4. The ECON botton is a good addition, but as far as its effect on fuel economy is concern its not very significant. Yes if you are a rash drive or like to push your car hard then ECON option will save some fuel for you as it limits your car performance and change your driving style. For me as I often drve with soft foot its effect on economy is almost nil and I really to like to drive with ECON on as its limits your gear shift and for downshift you have to push car hard and its response get too slow. new 1.6 dual vvti altis is way better in economy then new civic.  5. There is no engine noise in cabin and you really enjoys a peace in drive, but then when you push car its gives you a roaring sound and a great acceleration. Normally at 80km/hr speed RPM is stable at 1.5 and at 120km/hr its on 2.5. The fuel economy on highways is way better then in city and it can easily give to 15km/hr on highway.  6. front projected lights are a good addition from honda.  7. and off-course immobilizer.  Overall its a very nice car. I love the shape and love its interior. Being a corolla fan for years, now I'm enjoying my Honda Civic.  Yup friends honestly as compare to reborn, this car has a better drive better economy, improved handling with EPS and EBD. front drive side and passenger side airbags in i-vtec variant.

Chery QQ 0.8 Comfortable,"When you spend 1.4 million of your hard earned money you look for comfort, style and fuel economy to some extent as well. For me the experience so far is satisfying if not so great. The over all looks are good, although interior is made up of cheap plastic and even after using it for 14000KM in last 1.5 year it has never gave me major rattling noises. Fuel economy is good but the drawbacks are poor acceleration and really bad suspension.

Honda Civic VTi Oriel Prosmatec 1.8 i-VTEC,"I am a hardcore fan of Honda civic since 2002,I had Toyota corolla SE saloon,I wanted some change so I bought civic(2001-2004) model.I felt great when I sat in the drivers seat,when I touched the steering wheel,and when I turned it,it was as smooth as silk,since then,I'm in love with civic.From the 2001-2004 model to the eagle eye civic,to reborn.I have all :D.Since then,I realised that I was wasting my money on corolla.In August,my friend told me about the new civic launch which was in October.I didn't waste a single minute and went on Honda's website and I checked it.I booked it in August and got it on 30th of September.To be honest,I didnot not expect this.This car is too good.It is very powerful and is a perfect family sedan with more space and more grip.I think,looking at the dollar currency rate right now,the price for the car is perfect.Interior is not that attractive but it's good,there is more space.The exterior of the car is just to good,I have this car in pearl white and it is brilliant.People are saying that this is a flop in America and Dubai,the reason is that there are better cars there,better than civic.But over here,civic is the best and it will remain the best.It is better than corolla in all ways.So guys,go for civic.

Toyota Corolla GLi 1.3 VVTi,"I always loved the civic style, the sporty look and the indash speedometer. But after driving both cars in different types of roads I finally went for Altis, I have to go up north where roads are always in bad shape. Civic has suspension which cannot afford bumps and humps. Toyota can bear everything which comes in it's path. Also one can feel the bumps more in civic as compared with toyota. Yes when it comes to drive on moterway, civic takes the lead.  Comfort is perfect, as good as civic, specially the cruise control let's your legs relax on motor way while you are driving 400km to ISL.  Performance I will give it one less as when it comes to pick of the car, civic will give you instant boost when you floor the accelerator as compared to corolla which you might be a bit lazy.  Value for Money for sure, within this price range the features offered are comparable with any other car in the market.  Fuel Economy is far better than civic.

Corolla has a bigger and solid body which is very durable for years while City is a bit sensitive in this case  Now coming to the other side City has good power to weight much better pick and a very smooth drive as the its engine horsepower and torque is more than Corollas!!!  City has got very cool colours such as Alabaster Silver, Taffeta White, Polish Metal, Deep Lapis Blue Metallic, Crystal Black, Habanero Red amd and Bold Beige Metallic!!!  and coming to the end i believe that the brakes of City are better than Corolla as they are ABS AND YOU KNOW Honda ABS is awesome!!!

Chevrolet Joy 1.0 CNG,It is interesting to see Honda being compared to Toyota on Pak Wheels. It is just like comparing BMW to Suzuki. Only people who do not know how to control the car find Honda suspension troublesome. Poor drivers just cannot drive Honda. They can only drive Toyota. Since it is falling apart from the first day any day. Even Mehran puts in better quality interior than Toyota Pakistan. The seating length and width is sufficient enough to hold a two year old in Toyota. And don't forget when you reach 60KM/Hour it seems as if Toyota is going to be blown away by the wind and you feel as if you are going in a donkey cart instead of a car. Now on the other hand check out the interior of even City leave alone Civic and you will know what class is. The faster you go the smoother the drive is. Corolla is just alot of rolla!

All of these are usually extras, such as, alloy rims, power steerings, power windows, central locking, ABS, fog lamps, etc. These are all available here. The only thing is it does not have a bigger boot (diggy) as compared to sedans.

Suzuki Liana AXi,"8th generation civic is better than new Corolla and city. there r several reasons for it which are;  1. Corolla and City 2008-20012 is very light car having very less road grip. u won't enjoy it after having civic. plus city and Corolla 2009-2012 has no anti-theft (immobilizer) system in it where as civic has. U will be care free after buying civic. i am suggesting u coz recently i have seen 3 cases of steeling brand new Corollas and city. even Swift or Liana is better then city and corolla in security system.  2. There is not much difference of economy between city and civic. i.e Corolla and city gives 14 to 15 km/liter in city, where as civic manual transmission gives 11-12km/liter in city. so there is not much difference in economy if u compare the class of cars. .

Suzuki Swift DLX Automatic 1.3,"This review is intended for sharing my point of view regarding the Civic and Axio. An individual in one of the reviews below has asked for opinions, so here's mine.  The civic no doubt looks better, has a little more spacious interior and a more powerful engine giving it the edge in performance. The build quality however, is certainly not going to match the standards of the japanese.  While the Civic is made locally and purchasing it will give a boost to the economy of our dear country, sadly the quality control agency seems to be asleep as most of the parts and bits are very very cheap for a saloon costing nearly 20 lacs.  The Axio is going to be much better in the terms of build quality and ride refinement. This is because it is brought re-conditioned and is japanese assembled. The latest model with the new head-lamps and tail-lights is very good looking.  This great website will help with the latest prices of each model and i guess both these cars are mostly in the same range. The axio may be less expensive in some cases, depending upon the model year and condition.  To summarize:  >The advantages of Civic: . Style . Spacious and hi-tech interior. . Performance . Spare parts availability  >The problems with Civic: . Less fuel efficient. . Average build quality  >The advantages of Axio: . Solid build quality . Efficient Engine . Excellent ride, sound insulation and refinement  >The problems with Axio: . Spare parts difficult to find. . Second Hand value is poor (High Depreciation) . A bit bland in styling department.  I hope this is helpful :). More ",1-rating,0-rating,0-rating,3-rating,2-rating

Suzuki Mehran VXR,"I had always been a fan of corolla and have driven the following models quite frequently, 82, 86, 2001(indus), 2005, 2006(2d saloon) and 2010(new shape). one thing i must admit and im sure few of u will disagree with me, over the the years corolla has lost its credibility and the present model is crap. the 2002-2007 model had serious stability issues and the driver side power window malfunctions on every second model, the new corolla is no good either. stability has improved but it has sluggish acceleration, interior is old school, new steering and accelerator system is also a failure as it has lag. and i also dont understand why corolla makes this roundish type car designs....... then one day i decided not to follow my brain and went for my heart. i bought a honda civic eagle eye UG and afterwards a reborn vti oriel prosmetic. i think my driving experience has changed manifold here are my pros and cons PROS 1. Extremely hitech interior 2. Very responsive engine ( faster than altis 1.8) 3. Quality material used 4. Very nice handling and cornering 5. superb design, with sharp angles giving it a mean look 6. steering and throttle are very responsive  CONS 1. Its a bit fuel hungry 2. Spares are costly 3. maint is a bit costly  i once had a race with a corolla altis and by the time the car shifted to third i cud see the altis 1.8 in my rear view mirror, in short i would advise for those hooked up on rollas, just drive a honda and see what you have been missing More ",4-rating,3-rating,2-rating,5-rating,4-rating

Talking about its steering it is too soft as it is eps.Now iam planning to buy gli to upgrade my ride . The important plus point of my ride is that it will not disappoint me as far as money is concerned when i sell it as it has got best resale value.

Chevrolet Joy,"style is good,superior to all small cars available in paksitan i.e vitz and cultus etc.  comfort...my personal experience is that this car is very comfortable for all but not for driver.no doubt that very large space and a lot off adjustables are available for driver but i tired too much when i drove it 970 kms in two days.two persons were available for this long drive but still we tired too much and it was not a good experince.we covered this same long route on coure also.and coure is a small car but we were quite fresh with long drive of coure.  performance is very good,ac is very good,on petrol max speed 165 km with zero vibration.engine temp gauge always remains on same position in all conditions i.e as weather, speed, load, road condition etc..even after 12000 km i have no need to add water for engine cooling.its still factory filled fluid in the tank with same level as at time of delivery.  value of money.....what i can say about that i bought brand new and with documents it cost me in 11 lacs..and now after 6 months the available show room price is 11.5 and if i think that if i try to sale it and i can recover my whole amount.  fuel economy.....after my a lots off calculations and observations, i found that it cost me 7.5 rupees per km(if petrol 106/litre)...dont forget that in this price u enjoy a chilled a.c, power steering, power break,and power windows.  over all......on petrol if u can afford,its is the best in small cars.  my personal experience.....  if u are fully loaded ( 5 passengers) it can hit even with those speed breakers also from where u have crossed smoothly before  .....back mirror range area is very small as compare to other cars,this can tease u if u depends frequently on back mirror .....there is a small antena on the roof made up with soft rubber alike material.it tease u when u cover the car with a normal canvas cover.if u dont have a suitable hole in cover then with the weight of cover, antena tends to bent slowly in banana shape which does not look beautiful.

The interior is not of good quality. The engine makes very much sounds. The car applies too much force on the engine when going uphill and cultus has larger body as compared to alto and they both have the same engine of 1000cc. So i think that altois cheaper and better than cultus. Instead of buying a new cultus worth 925,000 you can buy 2004-5 model corolla or honda city.

Toyota Corolla Altis SR 1.6,"Look Friends its been a long time that people are trying to push Civic against corolla. Today um here with some solid justifications. I've driven both the cars so i'll talk with proof  Style:No doubt, New Corolla is also Beautiful BUT Honda launched its current style in 2006 and since then Toyota has changed it twice or even thrice. Still Civic is being sold at a remarkably higher price then Corolla,s all variants and is the choice of executive class. why?  Comfort: I think its a naturally proven fact that suspension of Honda has ever been much better and comfortable than Corolla. People who have driven it, know it  Performance: Acceleration of both the cars(Civic and ALTIS) is Excellent but one Honda has is a bit more stable  VFM: Both the cars are too much expensive.....  Fuel Economy: I've personally driven Civic 15.2 KM/ Liter of fuel. Corolla 1300 cc drives less than it.  Interior: Honda has a stylish interior since 2006 with a strong, luxurious, Elegant and Inspiring finish. Corolla never had  Road Grip: Civic has a better road grip due to its unique body design  Special Features: Availability of some standard as well as some optional features give Civic superiority over Corolla like Digital SPEEDO,Small Sporty Steering, Great Audio System with built in 6 CD changer/ Navigation, Leather seats, rear reading lamps and Anti- Theft system etc  Overall:  Civic V/S corolla oh sorry Rolla has no comparison  More ",5-rating,1-rating,2-rating,4-rating,5-rating

Toyota Corolla GLi Automatic 1.6 VVTi,"New corolla comes with lots of versions. 1.3L is underpowered, 1.8L consumes more fuel. But 1.6L Super ECT is best car in the corolla range. It has perfect balance of power and fuel economy. Plus Super ECT has smoother shifts, more fuel economy and delivers good performance, based on two modes, power and normal.

Very balanced shape and comes with standard ABS. inside stereo comes with USB port and fuel meter. Only drawback of this car is that it is very expensive as compare to 1.3L models, and price is not justified for 1.6L engine and Automatic transmission. Plus CNG installation may be a problem in this car, because of complex tuning issue.  If you can afford this car as it is, it is best choice in the country in 1.6L cars, since only Suzuki Liana is the other model which comes in 1.6L engine and automatic transmission.

Daihatsu Terios,"Mine arrived six months back and I must say I am disappointed. Yes disappointed at manufacturers like Toyota, Honda and the likes. The Swift turns out to be a direct and ruthlessly angry stare in the eyes of the other 1.3 liter counterparts. Positives of swift are certainly a lot more than the Negatives. For Instance the Alloy wheels, Imported Tires, Power/window-mirror-steering, and the worthiest mention ABS add great value to the overall package that one pays for. A relatively decent sound system with only one downside (The speakers buzz at high bass levels, obviously on high volumes). The car overall pays-off fairly well given the amount spent. Before i forget to assert on the ridiculous mileage, let me just add that the kind of power swift delivers would certainly bear a price tag that comes in the form of high fuel consumption. But then again the power delivered through the 1.3 liter mechanical piece of art justifies that to a great extent. I have managed to attain a 10km/l mark within the city, which is decent. Fill the tank and a one-side sprint on motorway can be done in a little more than half a tank equating it to around 18km/l. I have had a chance to manage a pocketful of road tickets on motorway for speeding, but my toe just wouldnt ease without flooring the gas pedal. Crank it, kill it and knock the 175 km/h barrier fairly easily. And by the way I love doing that. I heard Great work Suzuki. Simply love it. More ",5-rating,3-rating,3-rating,4-rating,0-rating

Toyota Corolla XLi VVTi,"Got mine in the 1st week of January. Since it was the first Suzuki in the family, I was a little skeptical on how things would turn out. The first 500kms have been alhamdulillah satisfying. The fuel average that I got (that's after the 1st refilling of the tank) is 12.98 km/l. I've seen people saying it doesn't give more than 9-10 initially but 12.98 is what I got. This includes extra urban (traffic jams) as well as straight roads mostly with no a/c since its winter. The new integrated in-dash is a nice touch. The volume knob is so easy to operate just like the one in the Vti-Oriel. Since mine is to be used as a second car (self use only with primary commuting to office and home), I was initially planning for the DX version but the additional 100 grand it worth the dough. Keyless entry is a must and so is ABS and Alloys ad a little glamour to the overall silhouette of the body. If budget is not a problem, the DLX is the one to go for. Nonetheless, Suzuki should be commended to provide basic amenities like PW and Central locking in the base version. Not to mention imported tyres too. Things I dont like There is no assist grip for the driver and there are no jacket hangers at the rear assist grips. The steering despite being electrically assisted feels a like heavier than my steermatics. And it isnt as precise either. Legroom at the rear is virtually non-existent and people with families should look at other options too. Overall a nice package and good value for money.

Bla Bla Bla! all goes down the drain when its costs me 4000 to drive it for 250 Kilometers;  Cultus on the other hand is middle class persons dream with Exceptional fuel economy, plenty of space, parts cheaper than any other car in the market, good pick and drive.  yes! Suzuki needs to do something seriously about quality control since i had to take my car three times for adjustments (be it swift or cultus).  all in all considering that coure costs 9 lacks and swift around twelve; Cultus is EXCELLENT value for money at 10 lackhs.

Suzuki Cultus VXRi,"I read several reviews, some people like, some doesn't like it all. After reading some reviews I am confused. I have asked my relative to buye me Cultus with CNG. Since I will be visiting Pak in few weeks. I am sure In few days arrangements will be made for buying new Cultus with factory fitted CNG.  I live in USA and will be using this car few weeks a year on my visit to Pak.  I know in 2009 Suzuki offered power stearing, alloy wheels, fog lights and power windows previously.  To my disappointment these accessories are not being offered now. I want a car with dual fuel factory fitted CNG, not after market install.  As far as I know, right now Toyota and Suzuki are they only ones. Offers petrol and CNG in few models. Choices is very limited in Pak for dual fuel.  I like Toyota crolla with factory fitted CNG, but driving few weeks in a year doesn't justify to spend close 18 grands. So I decided to go far Cultus 2011.  Though it's 2012 but still in Pak market 2012 Cultus is not available yet. I don't understand why is that. Here in USA 2012 models were available in Sept. every year.  I visited Pak Suzuki web site and was very disappoined. Very minimal informations were available about their freking products.  Under specification O is written. I thought it mean ""optional"" . It should have been S ""Standard"".  Any way I would like to ask this forum. When new models of cars comes in market. Such as 2012. Kindly reply to my ???? Thanks.

Suzuki Liana,"Sir, in that case and according PAMA Suzuki Mehran has a sale of 14,134 units and while Dahatsu cuore sold only 1728 units. So according to your equation what mehran would be a better car then cuore wouldn't it be? You don't compare cars from their selling ratio. You compare them from their performance, value for money and services given in them. Now why toyota has more sales. Look first of all I don't think that anybody rational would say that Liana is better than corrolla that's a fact whether anybody admits it or not. And selling of more units is because of having the great reselling price and most of all the durability this car is offering, no other car even honda is giving it to its users. Great shocks with good life of engine even in rural areas. That's why its competing. If you look for value of money, meaning the price you are paying for the services you are getting, Sir you have to admit that Liana will get more rating. 1.2 M and it gives you everything that 1.4 M Xli doesn't give and 1.55 M Gli do gives you with an additinal abs, Thats it.

Toyota Corolla GLi 1.3 VVTi,"I purchased 0 meter liana in 2008 and have driven almost more then 100000 kms. Its a good car no doubt but it has many flaws. It do has a missing problem. You do have to press race on it before leaving the clutch meaning it needs proper combustion in its engine before you let the clutch go. its a car which gives you great pleasure while accelerating but stops your heart when it comes to brake. Suzuki should think about brakes even their abs system ain't very good, i don't have it but I do have reviews of many who have liana with abs. I was reading a review that missing problem on low gears in cng is pretty much high and he did alot to get out of it but nothing worked. I also experienced it, as I said it does that but there is a point it starts doing it in a very intolerable manner. The problem is with the coils. change them and you will find a huge difference in it. But original coils are very expensive. A set of those is more then Rs 20,000.

In terms of suspension and cornering, the Civic is miles ahead of Corollas, Sunnys etc and is a pleasure to drive. The auto transmission shifts seamlessly and quietly, and the engine is very responsive in both city and highway driving.

S500 must be a mean beast :)  Any desires left with E class, hmmm, i wish it had bigger LCD SCREEN like in BMW 5 series. Also, when you are driving over 120km/h the main speedometer screen keep on bitching that you have exceeded maximum limit and that space is useless until you decrease speed, like you cannot view the KM or fuel economy on that screen.

Toyota Corolla GLi 1.3 VVTi,"It is the pioneer in sense that it is the only and only 1000 cc carburetor car at this time in the world. It has SJ-410 970 cc 4 cylinder carburated Engine. This engine was made by suzuki Japan in 1985 for Suzuki Jeeps and was used by paksuzuki for potohar jeep (The only discontinued model of Paksuzuki otherwise they never discontinue any vehicle like Mehran). This engine is fitted with a 5 speed gear box which is designed in such a way that its lower gear ratios are very close to each other because it was intended to be used in Jeep. However, when paksuzuki discontinued Potohar jeep they started to fit this engine in Alto. The body shape of this car is also running in some countries like Saudi Arabia etc., but not with this engine. Also this car in those countries has not permission to come on motorways. It is due to this reason that some people observe and say that alto engine in very powerful and it climbs mountains with ease. It is true that it climbs mountains easily, even easier than cultus, but its power is same as that of cultus. it is just because of gear ratios. i would not mind if Napak Suzuki Motor Company fits jeep engine in car, but at least they should have evaluated some dynamics. Since this engine is not for car. Due to misfit engine this car has it center of gravity near its center (which should be near front wheels) so turning this car at high speed results in swing around center and loss of control or turn over of car upside down. Therefore this car is higly unstable on road at speeds above 90 km/hr. In this respect it is even worse than Mehran.you can say it FALTO. handling and drive of this car is good, but keep in mind it is not safe at high speeds. Brakes of this car are good. But if you replace its stock tires otherwise paksuzuki install 145mm tread tires which have no surface area to grip the road. AC is good when the car is running at high speeds Engine does not become very hot or hard with AC, but cooling of AC is a problem. only front two passengers can travel in city with AC. It has no RPM meter. It fuel economy at CNG is good and at petrol approximately 12-16 km/l.  Door trim of this car are very good made up of entire moulding with plastic which even suzuki is not offering in cultus. Ac knobs are rotary type which look good like sedan cars. Seats are not comfortable but not roasting like seats of Mehran. Inside space is insufficient especially for rear passengers. Body is good looking and compared to all other small cars of paksuzuki it is good value for money. More ",5-rating,5-rating,5-rating,1-rating,0-rating

Secondly, it is not load bearing. Means if four normal person sit in it, the body almost starts touching the rear wheel. No room for luggage.

Suzuki Alto,"If you are looking for luxury in a small package, this car is for you. Engine size is large and power to weight ratio is excellent.

Small goodies that add up to a lot include japanese tyres, jvc cd player, cup-holders, central locking, electronic keys (ignition impossible without original keys), powerful blower in the AC, good-sized boot (one standard size luggage item can stand in the same space, comparable to what you are left with if you install CNG in a city) Fuel economy is excellent. With a mix of motorway driving (120 constant, overtaking >130) and city driving, I am getting over 13kms on a litre. No vibrations in cabin etc till 150km/hr. Excellent value for money considering that for a similar price you only get a refurbished vitz with 300cc less engine or a 2 year driven city, which will start mechanical trouble in an year of use.

Keep an eye on the front there cuz the new honda civic (already available in the middle east and coming soon in pakistan) is gonna have a very very similar front. Smooth as silk. Slightly hard suspensions but on urban and long routes, its seamless. great looking interior. Cheapest brand new Automatic car here in Pakistan. I love its rear cuz it looks quite similar to BMW 318. Some people say they dont get a reasonable fuel economy nothing above 7 or 8 km/l, please get your city completely checked by honda. You should get 11-13 in the city in summers, around 16 on the motorway and around 18 on GT rd. THis is a very well balanced car in terms of the drive. It gives you immense control over your drive. Thanks to that, I have avoided a lot of hard situations, accidents. Nice queit i-vtec 1.3 engine that gives you reasonable enough power. On automatic transmission, it might seem a little less at times but a more expert drives can take out more power from it.  I would never sell it had I been staying in Pakistan. Its a keeper!

Daihatsu Cuore CX Eco,"The New Honda City is not a car to waste 1.4 Million Rupees. The Car is hugely overpriced in Pakistan. in the other parts of the world it serves as a middle class car as it is sold in only Thailand, Pakistan and India. Only the Pakistani market of New Honda City is higher as compared to other countries where it is mostly purchased by middle class people who cant afford to buy a much bigger car like the Corolla. In Pakistan, due to its excessive price, people have started to compare it with Corolla Xli or Even a Gli, which is a mistaken anomaly. Xli and Gli are a car in the Compact Class category having wider Wheel Base while City is a Sub-Compact Car. No where in the World does a sub-compact car is compared with a Compact Car. This is due to this simple science that a bigger car is always more attractive, expensive and of higher category than a smaller car. For example You cannot Compare a Camry with Altis or u cannot compare a Accord with Civic. The former cars are more huge and more expensive and they are meant for the More Elite Class. Similarly, corolla is purchased by a higher class people in the world while City is desgined for the middle class people due to its Sub-Compact Category.  So the bottom line is that City is not the car to be compared with the Corolla as bigger cars always attract the eye more than the smaller ones. So please stop comparing 2 cars of totally different category. If u wanna compare Corolla with City then u must buy a car of Compact Category such as the Civic.  U can compare the New City with Toyota Belta and the Older Model City with Toyota Platz as both fall in sub-compact category. More ",5-rating,5-rating,5-rating,1-rating,4-rating

Honda Accord VTi 2.4,"Well after reading alot of CIVIC vs CORROLLA I decided to write my own review as we keep a corrolla and a civic at all times. I agree with ayubian2 in the sense that one cant compare corrolla with civic the main reasons being: 1. corrolla is a multi purpose vehilcle it performs on off-road as well as on metal road but doesnt give extreme performance on neither side. Because of its soft suspension it doesnt offer much control or rather the feeling of being in control on plain roads in high speeds, on rough terrain there is always the problem of road clearence in corrolla as well(lesser than civic tho) 2. corrolla is designed to be long lasting with cheap maintenance which is not required for longer periods of time that is the reason many countries prefer corrolla (or camry) to be driven as taxis. 3. Civic is not a multi purpose vehicle it is designed for plain roads only doesnt offer much on rough terrain infact its a nightmare! Its stiff suspension makes is perfect for high speeds as it offers alot more control for example if there is a turn and a corrolla would pass that turn on 80km/h and no more, a civic could very well make that turn on speeds as high as 140 to 160 km/h without any anxious feelings. 4. Maintenance wise civic requires much more care than a corrolla, and is much more expensive, but the drive is that much more addictive as well. 5. as far as feul economy is concerned in EFI engines if the RPM is roughly below 3000 then any EFI car is in economy mode, above that there is no concept of feul economy just performance(true for corrolla as well as civic as well as any other EFI engine). The base line is both civics and corrollas are built for different purposes, the former built for style and (is technologically advanced) metal roads, the later built to last longer with support for multiple terrains. So it could be argued but in my opinion if one has to take real mileage from his/her car that is as high as 200 to 300 km per day on average, corrolla should be the first choice, if one wants a car just for his driving pleasure in style and low mileage in mostly in city drives AND HE/SHE can AFFORD to lose money on resales, civic would be very appropriate for such party. Example1: we took a mileage of 5lacs and 50thousand kilometers from a corrolla(japanese) in just 4 years and sold it without any maintenance at a price that was 5thousand PKRs less than our buying price! Example2: we took a mileage of 40thousand kilometers from a pakistani civic in just 18months with about 50thousandPKRs maintenance INCLUDING TYRES and sold it for fifteen thousand PKRs less than our buying price! But one thing is for sure the driving pleasure that one gets in a civic is far far far more than wut one gets in any corrolla! Do the math :) PS: corrolla is ideal if one doesnt like to drive and employs a driver to drive ;) hope this was insightful for some atleast :) do the math :)  More ",3-rating,4-rating,5-rating,3-rating,4-rating

Gli: 1)seats not comfortable,makes u tired at long journeys. 2)brakes r not good,car looses control on braking at high speeds n goes on one side if press the brake pedal hard. 3)got an average max. average of 12km/liter. 4)pick-up is good. 5)dash board n other parts starts making sounds even at a very low mileage of below 70,000. 6)Suspension is best for family travelling of 5 persons with trunk full of luggage,body never touches ground even on jumps.best for family of 5. 7)interior is better than city as it is of cream colour,doesn't catch much dust,u don't need to clean it again n again. 8)spare parts r cheap n available every where. 9)it has a great re-sale,da car is a running cheaque.

Suzuki Cultus VXRi (CNG),"The Toyota Corolla and Honda Civic are currently the two leaders in the compact car segment. Like their bigger brothers, the Camry and Accord, these two have a dedicated fan base due to their practicality and renowned Toyota and Honda quality. The Corolla is the friendlier one while the Civic kicks it up a notch with a more distinctive design and the sporty Si trim.  Toyota: The 2012 Toyota Corolla is the best end for a conservative driving experience in the new decade. Corolla 2012 has a 4-cylinder engine, the mileage is a hundred times better than a lot of its competitors in the market. The Toyota Corolla 2012 is a visual appeal to the loyal buyers but will essentially carry the same sedan style that was introduced in 2009 as Corollas 10th design generation.

As far as the price is concerned, I think its not at all the worth of its rice. The prices should be somewhat low as what they are right now.

Honda City 1.3 i-VTEC,"OK, so I got the delivery of a brand new Honda City MT last week and below is what I have to say: The drive is very smooth, even when compared to my previous Steermatic (if you discard the difference of transmission, that is). The engine is almost noiseless, the cabin is very secluded too. The steering is very smooth as well. The black interior is a pain. Not only is it super prone to dust, it also makes the car unbearably hot to sit in when under direct sunlight. The interior quality is also below par. I expected better. Compared to the earlier model of City, I don't see any improvement in the cabin room size. Feels the same. The internal sheet between the engine and the cabin is very thin, it seems. The horn sounds to be going off inside the cabin, it's that loud. I have been driving the car for around a week now and so far, the econometer says that I am doing around 14.1 kmpl in the city with 100% AC on. Looks good but I can only confirm if this is accurate once I refill. All in all, I like the car but I feel I deserved better in 1.4 million. Things like rear speakers, alloy rims, better tyres should be standard in this amount. More ",2-rating,2-rating,1-rating,3-rating,1-rating

Honda City,"buying 800cc with auto option doesn't leave you with any choice. price is therefore high, significantly high. comfort, look and sitting space wise car is superior to Suzuki offering in same category. finishing of car is generally better than other counterparts. still you can't drive it to 500 KM in a single run. fuel consumption is really disappointing - 11Km/Ltr. pick is excellent on petrol, on CNG you will fee change of gears as a hurdle. breaking with AC on COLD mode is very poor, if you are running AC+CNG you will be in trouble if you have to break at anything above 50Km/h with less than 10 feet to stop. if you want to pick someone from airport you better go alone- it doesn't have space for luggage. taking out spare wheel from back of the car is a nightmare. you can park it where you will see spot for moterbike- good thing for congested markets. ladies love this car since it doesn't have a clutch. for family with kids i will not recommend it as they can't take family and picnic material in one trip. i recommend this car to single upper middle class teens, for everyone else keep searching.

The car no doubt attractive but i think the car price worth at Europe sides n different countries like at there the price of it around about 25-26K that worth if you convert in Pakistani Rs they are like 3.3-3.4 million Rs but ova here the price of it Rs5-6millions. I personally don't think it does worth. Instead of get this car person should get Audi A4 more stylish and comfort of it more than it and price of it lesser than it.

Suzuki Alto VXR (CNG)," I have Chev Joy 2009 black. It is still running very fine. Its can give you about 18-20 km/L on petrol on long routes and about same on CNG. Inside cities, it gives u about 11-14 km /L or Kg of CNG. I dont find any problem with CNG. Keeping in view the performance, comfort and advance features, this car is much much better than its competitors like Suzuki Cultus (I have also this car) etc. However, I think this car is in the hands of wrong importers and local providers. The main problem with this car is the in-competency of the proper mechanics and their dishonesty to put wrong spare parts. I discussed with importers/providers many times to rectify the problems but feel that probably they dont want to promote it. If these problems are rectified. Chev Joy can compete Toyota vitz in coming years as it has same power, strong body and good shape but it is more comfortable and economical than even Toyota Vitz.  I could not understand why Chev Joy or Spary promoters dont want to promote it more. Have they some indulgence from other companies which are Chevrolete competitors in Pakistan??????????

Despite being a very rich country, they are delivering this car in their country with very smart engine, its average on petrol is 4.2 L / 100km. And in Pakistan they are delivering it with 80's potohar carburetor engine with average 6 L /100 km on petrol. In city it becomes worse as 10L/100km. Thats why Japanese manufacturers never mention fuel consumption in their specs. However, we are thankful to them at-least they are providing us cars that run on our bumpy roads for years.

Toyota Corolla Altis 1.6,Bought this car for about a month ago and totally satisfied with its performance. Fuel consumption is good altough i havent checked it on motorway but make sure that this thing runs actually and u feel ur seat slipping beneath u. The only drawback i felt is the diggy altough for a single person its more than enough. Doors are a lil bit hard and donot close like in honda or corolla.

Chevrolet Optra 1.6 Automatic,"A year ago, when i left my bank job, i had to retrun the bank provided corolla (GLi 2008 model) back to the bank. At that time i was not much aware about the prices of used car but i was shocked to learn that a used 1000cc car like cultus and vitz is selling at a price range of 700k to 1100k. While all the bigger cars were kind of out of my budget and affordibility. Still I wanted a bigger car and classy car and optra 2005 got all one expects in a car of class. It comes with full option that even reborn or all new corolla failed to offer till now and that too at a price of a cultus. I have been a proud owner of the car now for more than a year and love to drive the car, especially on motorway where the beast like engine of the car gets a chance to flex its muscles. The airconditioning is supberb and the climate control keeps the inside of the car comfortable, while the cool box keeps the water, drinks and chocolates cool during the long journeys. The driving seat has the legs and lumber support keeping the long drives pleasureable and tireless. The spares of the car are easily available in Lahore from Montgomery Road and Chevy Platinum Motors at a very reasonable price (parts are cheaper than vitz and new swift). A good well maintained used optra is available at a price range of 850K to 950k, which according to me is the best value for money. The only problem with the car is that there are no service centers or spare parts availability in smaller cities. I strongly recommend the car to people who want to drive bigger car at a price of a cultus.  More ",4-rating,5-rating,4-rating,5-rating,4-rating

Honda City 1.3 i-VTEC,"I ve had my ride for about 8 months now. i shifted from a Cuore, so i had a genuine learning experince first few months.  All in all, City is an excellent car.  Body&interior: It is shaped beautifully, and the interior is awesome as well. In fact, the car is very roomy when you sit inside. The Dashboard is highquality and well laid out with dual glove compartments adding to the benifit. The seats are comfortable (atleast to me) and the car has ample bootspace (even with CNG).  Engine/Mechanics: The car is very smooth and feels powerful enough in city driving (never drove on a highway yet). The best part about this car is its milage rate and the Air Conditoner. The car is a dream to drive, both on CNG and Petrol, and summers are enjoyable with the level of cooling it provides. The braking and accelration is good as well  All in All, it is a goood car for city driving by a small family.  The cons, that i have felt are below: (in my humble opinion. please dont start a honda vs toyota fight)  1) The engine bay is a bit cramped and low on space. especially if you get CNG installed, you ll have a bit of trouble in changing the light bulbs.  2) being a honda, i dont really like its suspension. It is superb, but only as long as you drive on good paved roads. It deteriotes faster than a corolla if driven on rough roads. Plus, its suspension works are costlier to maintain.  3) The Lights, in my car, its always one bulb or the other that is going out in teh headlights. i have 3 mates with the same car and we all have a residen tproblem with our headlights.  4) again, in all 3 cars of this model that i have driven, i have come to not trust the fuel gauge. even 500 rs worth of petrol sends its needle soaring to the middle. i just think its a bit un reliable.  5) the side frame f windscreen deals a serious blow to visibility, especially whole turning on junctions (but you get used to it)  all in all, it is a good car. but i would rather go for a corolla if given the option now, solely because of the suspension as i drive on rought roads a bot.  Hope this helps.   More ",5-rating,4-rating,0-rating,4-rating,5-rating

Apart from that it is very reliable and easy to maintain and its always welcome in the second hand car market.

Suzuki Liana RXi,Had it for about three weeks and based on that experience I would say that the car is well equipped in comparison with other cars of the same category. Power steering is as smooth as butter. Power windows and power mirrors further add to the list of things that would attract potential customers. After market CD player and that is all you need. The engine is German and performs rather well on petrol. On CNG the performance is not effected BUT the life of the engine get reduced dramatically. The engine bay is too cramped up for local mechanics and only those with strong nerves or those with no brains get themselves involved with a Chery. Parts are available but only of you know where to look. But still its a daunting task. The ride is smooth but will become some what unstable on higher speeds and bumpy roads. All in all a good car for use within city and a no no for inter city. The accelerator position will take its toll on your ankle but the seats are comfortable and so is the leg room.

When I returned I was looking for Auto transmission so I purchased Eminent which was recomended by my cousin and car dealers. There is no doubt this car is superb. I kept through out on Petrol very nice, smooth and comfortable drive. Car is far better than Corolla Xli or GLi however one car compare with Vti or Altis but price tag is alot better than Vti or Altis. Runs very good but little heavy on Petrol (May be it is because I use O/D button too much). It is not as spacious as Civic or Corolla (for 4 person its fine) but when you sit in it you can feel luxury and solidness around with stylish interior. Engine sound is very quiet but when you thrust it's accleration one can feel roaring engine with speed which feels good. If someone is asking for buying, I would 100% recomend Eminent.

Toyota Corolla,"Its been over 3 months now that I have owned this car and so far my experience with it is just remarkable.  I have given 5/5 to almost all of its ratings. This wasn't out of excitement. Actually I can explain that one by one.  Style: The venom looks of the car and the sporty look make it look MUCH better than at least: Honda Civic, Old Shape city (duh!), Old Shape Corolla, Toyota Vitz and all cars manufactured and sold by Suzuki.  It looks almost equal, if not better than the new corolla.  So clearly there is no reason why we cannot give it a 5/5 for style.  Comfort: This is pretty much the same for all the new cars in this price range. In my personal experience, its more comfortable than its revival corolla (1.3L).  Performance: It goes from zero to hundred in way under 10 seconds. And comes from 100 to zero ALSO in less than 10 seconds. With the only car that offers ABS in this price range, its much safer and gives the driver a peace of mind (that his car is equipped with ABS). The i-vtec is definitely a powerful engine. It went from 100 - 190 in just about 100 seconds.  Value for Money: When I was buying this car, its price was around 1.25 Million. However, the only other option that I had was a Toyota Corolla. Corolla's price at that time was 1.29 million. This was the price of a car that DID NOT offer ABS or Power Windows (and was available in two colors only). The model that did offer these features was expensive by about 1.5 lack rupees.  Honda City produces 100 horse power, Corolla 1.3L on the other side (inspite of being expensive) produced 85 horse power (though Corolla eats more fuel, which is discussed below). This really is a good value for money because you get more than what you pay for.  Fuel Economy: I have not had experience of Honda City or Toyota Corolla in CNG. However, my limited study of Corolla's average on highways in Petrol turned out to be a little over 16 Kilometers per liter. My very own Honda City gave me 22.8 Kilometers per liter on a trip from Islamabad to Peshawar. This fuel average included a distance traveled within the city (about 30 kilometers). The i-vtec is a very fuel efficient engine. It produces more power compared to a vvti and consume's less fuel.  One reason why some people preferred Toyota Corolla was spaciousness. That is also very apparent and not particle. The passenger capacity for both cars is 5. However, Honda City's trunk is the most spacious one among all the cars of Pakistan. Any one who sees both the trunks together can easily see the massive difference of space. Its very tangible. The reason is that Honda's Fuel tank is below the front seats and so the rear trunk becomes deeper than the trunks of other cars.  In every aspect, I find this car very good value for money, very fuel efficient and comfortable.  Definitely something you wouldn't regret.  More ",4-rating,5-rating,5-rating,5-rating,5-rating

Toyota Corolla Altis 1.6,"While buying a small car i had three options i.e Mehran, Alto & Cuore. I was going to buy Mehran but my brother advised me to go for Cuore. I din't know about it except that it had better shape than Mehran and also more compact than Mehran. I learnt driving on Fx & Mehran. Mehran was better in driving than FX. But when i bought Cuore and drove it, Really i enjoyed it's drive. That's the point where Cuore beats Mehran and Alto. Despite being 847 cc, it performs like 1000 cc cars. Many times i've experienced racing with Altos and even Cultuses in the city and on motorways and many times i beat those 1000 cc cars.It's pick is awesome, probably best in 0.8 L category. It's performance is best on CNG as compared to other cars and there is a little difference in speed on both CNG and Petrol. It's interior is nice as compared to mehran and i really love it's dashboard. It looks small from outside but when someone sits inside, it looks roomier. It's build quality is better than Mehran and Alto. I would dare to say that it's more fuel efficient than Mehran. I've recorded it's average on motorway at constant speed of 90-100 km/hr both on CNG and Petrol. On CNG it's average is 33 km/kg and on petrol it gave me 22-23 km/litre. It's maintenance is not at all expensive. You wouldn't have the trouble to go to the mechanics very often. It's body is stronger than Mehran. More comfortable than mehran and performs much better than mehran. Only Negative points are it's a bit overpriced, Parts are expensive and resale not as good as that of Mehran.

The old GLI had a serious problem of braking but in this model that problem has been overcome with Toyota introducing ABS brakes in Corollla GLI. This car has an excellent fuel economy and gives about 15km/l on long routes at 110km/h.

I would not be so critical of the car though, had the price been placed correctly. This is why the Pakistani cars are never ""Loved"", and people perfer buying reconditioned Japanese builds rather than paying a fortune for cheap Tin and Plastic.  In general, I feel as people are becoming moreaware of their rights, they are also expecting value for their hard earned cash.  So, what will make me buy this car ?? better seats, ABS, a better braking system, CD player, Child Lock and a nicer ECM. More ",5-rating,3-rating,4-rating,1-rating,5-rating

Toyota Corolla 2.0D,"""If you don't have any worries, buy Mehran"" is 100% true for this car. This car, no doubt, have been the most successful one in the Pakistani market, and the reason behind this is not the superb quality but the cheaper price which fools nearly everyone. I have had this car for a while now and i am not happy with its performance. having not many points but still i would to elicit some Pros and Cons of this car. <<<<<<<<<>>>>>>>>>: 1. Cheaper, infect the cheapest 0.8L car in the world. 2. Low maintenance cost. 3. Good fuel economy in city so it is quite affordable. 4. Spare parts are cheap and easily available. <<<<<<<<<>>>>>>>>> 1. Very low quality body 2. low quality paint 3. very hard suspension, causes back ache, 4. headache and makes your car rattle. 5.very noisy engine 6. lousy brakes but this problem can be overridden by the selection of 165/70/R12 tires. 7. car runs OK till 30K KM, after that it becomes a nightmare to drive. 8. Parts are not reliable and wear out quicker than you think.  I recommend not to buy this car unless you are low on budget.  More ",3-rating,4-rating,3-rating,5-rating,2-rating

Suzuki Alto VXR (CNG),"i have driven alto for three years now and it seems to be as good as new even though it has been driven for 32000km. i personally believe that alto is the best car among the other cars that paksuzuki produces, in terms of reliability, stability, low cost of maintenance, fuel economy and at last but not the least comfort for its price tag.  only one minor concern that i would like to share is the somewhat noisy passenger cabin. i dont know whether it is because the low profile soundproofing arrangement or because of its engine's extra noise.  man its amazing for its fuel economy it gives me regularly 22 - 23 km/kg of cng on highway. sometime it exceeds even this, as when i last went to karachi from multan it gave me an amazing millage of 25 km/kg of cng.  currently i am planning to replace it with honda civic but guys truly when i think about this i become sad with this thought that i am not gonna have an alto anymore.

Honda Accord VTi 2.4,"I own a 2005 Coure & it is my first sub compact car. When I was looking for a car in this range many of my friends advised me to by a Mehran instead of Coure but Thanks to Allah Almighty I didn't! If compare it to Mehran( well I feel there is no Compare) there are certain points to considerwhich are as under 1- Coure's exterior is round cornered which looks more smart & aerodynamic than the box like exterior of Mehran. 2- Coure's exterior paint job is far more better than Mehran cuz I peronally see paint drip lines on brand new Mehrans but no such issue for Coure. 3- Chasis wise Coure is more strong as it has a rectunglar Chasis while Mehran has straight Chasis u could see many mehran's front wheels somewhat bending out of the Wheel houe as they were under some heavy weight , this is due to weak chasis. 4-Coure's interior is more comfortable & good looking while Mehran has inferior quality interior. 5- Coure's A/c is more powerful than Mehran's. 6- Under the hood coure 50 more CCs than Mehran thats why it has good pick & climbing power as compare to Mehran, moreover its engine is more responsive even on CNG. If u consider the price than I mus t say that the Coure is getting overly priced & the Toyota Company never give any good reason for that, but I still love to have Coure its really fun to drive specially in crowded cities like ours,its also OK on long drives though not very comfortable as they r not designed for long drives. In short abest car for small family with young kids & city drive. More ",5-rating,3-rating,5-rating,2-rating,5-rating

Suzuki Cultus VXLi (CNG),"I purchased this car some 2 months back after comparing specifications of Cuore, Alto and Cultus. I was looking for some small size car ... obviously because of garage parking issue :).  Was a little conscious because Chevorlet didn't allow test drive --- hence no verification on their claims. But was confident because of its foreign assembling and after reading a bit on Internet.  This turned out to be a joy ride over last 2 months. I am totally satisfied with luxurious feel of the car. The details, finishing is good ... no loose ends.  Interior is well designed, best usage of space you will find places to keep you wallet, mobile, coffee cup, water bottle, loose papers, tissue box and all in reach of hand.  Comfort while driving is great for this size car. Spacious in front -- real comfortable.  Back seats are relaxing with ample leg space. Drive from Lahore to Peshawar on motorway was not tiring.  A/C is perfect for 800cc car, even better than 1000cc (comparing to Cultus).  Its MTect-II 800cc engine by no means an 800cc engine, you can easily compare the performance with a 1000cc engine.  Exteror, body shape/strength all are good for this scale car.  Fuel consumption is approx 12km/litre in city and 15km/liter on motorway. The claim was 18km/litre. So it failed here. But still worth it. At 140km/h it is stable drive. The pick and speed is not that much effected by running A/C.  Above all it is with 2 yrs warranty or 50,000km which ever comes first. The knob to adjust fan speed had few problems after 1 month or purchase ... it was a connection solding issue, which i got fixed from a 3S dealer in no time. Staff was trained.  Do not go for Chevorlet Joy --- Spark is much better than that.  I will say best value for money, I am happy to pay Rs. 40,000 extra for this comparing to Cuore. I am a satisfied driver of Spark --- Alhamdu Lillah. More ",2-rating,5-rating,5-rating,5-rating,5-rating

Lower on the road and great aerodynamics it has. very economical as far as the maintenance concerned, now please don't compare it with suzuki mehran's maintenance. I don't know why people always compare the luxry of Mercedez/BMW or any other good car like Honda with the maintenance cost of Suzuki Mehran. Then it was the best mileage car on petrol as well as CNG. If you want to modify and enjoy sporty car then this is the best car to choose for. In short, if you want to compare the best cars in Pakistan as long as drive comfort is concerned then Honda is the best choice because you can see now a days market for resale as well.  oVerall, the bEst cAr I eVeR hAd.

Chevrolet Joy 1.0,"Plus:  1. Spacious, for a 800cc car. I've drove the Suzuki 800 before, and this QQ is really big in space. Once I was comfortable in the front, I went to the back, and my knees are not even rubbing the front seat back (I'm 1.78m). There are room to tuck in my feet too.  2. Power is so-so, but with the car weighing less than 0.9 ton, pickup is relatively brisk. Wouldn't say much about going fast on long distances, but for everyday cut-and-thrust traffic, it's pretty adequate. Those who say 800cc CMI probably didn't and wouldn't drive anything less than a litre.  3. Economy. Can't really verify but based on its capacity and its weight, I can safely say I can return smelly-smelly 20km/L!  4. Split rear bench. Can't all cars come with this? It really helps in increasing the versatility of an already small car. Maybe Kia can learn something from QQ and change theirs to 60:40 splits.  Minus:  1. The car is flimsy. Yes, flimsy. When you open the doors wide (you'll realise the QQ doors doesn't open as wide as you would want it), you'll see the hinge on the body starting to flex. Not a very safe sign here. Engine bay also presented its shoddy works, with just an L-shaped piece of metal holding on to the reservoir intake. All in, just one word - Flimsy. And provided you don't knock into anything, the car might not last a full 10 years out in the tarmac jungle.  2. Spongy seats. It reminds you of those cheap and thin 4"" tilam. You feel every poke if someone sitting behind is pushing his/her knee into the front seat backs. It reminds you also of Osim massage chairs, only it's just plain irritating.  3. Sticky gears. The auto will come next year (as I was told), and the manual gear is a nightmare. It is stiff and sticky as if there were no lubricants inside. I know it's a new car, but the tightness is a killer for, say, a lady driver. I did have some reservations in shoving and yanking the gears, they're just not well-oiled at all.

Daihatsu Cuore,"I feel it's an amazing ride inspired by its older sibling- the toyota camry! With its superior style & unmatchable comfort, the corolla again marks its footsteps as a trend-setter! The luxurious interior grasps the onlooker into its beauty. With the comparisons now being held all over the world with the Honda Civic reborn, the corolla has outdone itself by enhancing in stability, power & comfort leaving behind the civic for the first time! Now with its triptronic gear & cruise control, it excels all the other cars in its price range.  The rear of the vehicle, although highly similar to the previous corolla, still continues to be an icon of style. When i first saw the corolla cruisetronic, i was a littil bit disappointed because of its drastic similarity to the previous corolla, but i gained respect for it in time becuase of the high quality drive it has & its edges & cuts giving it a sporty touch.  Toyota has again given its engine a sound that amazes people in acceleration. According to my opinion, if u can afford to buy a cruisetronic, go ahead! Enjoy.
